In order to express a command which comes from a person with a higher hierarchical level an expression `verb + なさい` is used. Its common usage is a parents' command to children or instructions in exams (even though [ください](46) is more frequently used). Therefore, this command is used from someone who knows from experience that that is the way how to do things.
To construct the form *なさい* must be added to a verb stem.
>強くなりたいなら、もっと野菜を食べ**なさい**。If you want to become strong eat more vegetables.
>明日学校に行けなきゃから、早く寝**なさい**。Go to sleep early because to must go to school.
