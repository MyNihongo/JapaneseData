The expression `A + を込めて + B` means that the clause B is performed to the utmost with a feeling described in the clause A and it can be translated as *"full of"* or *"filled with*. The expression comes from the word [込める (こめる)](w1288790) which has several meanings, but the relevant translation is *"to put into (emotion)"*, therefore, it means that the speaker puts some emotions and performs the clause B. Emotions may be either negative or positive.
