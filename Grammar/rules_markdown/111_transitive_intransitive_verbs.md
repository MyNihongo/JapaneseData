Understanding a distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs is crucial. Here is a definition:
- transitive - verb which accepts one or multiple objects (e.g. I open a windows)
- intransitive - verb which does not accept any objects (e.g. a windows is open)

In English a pair of transitive and intransitive verbs is usually the same verb (e.g. *to open* as in the definition above), but in Japanese these verbs are different, therefore, it is imperative to learn which verbs are transitive and which are intransitive and not to confuse them.
An important grammar note is that with intransitive verbs a subject is **always** used with the ***が** particle*.
Below is a table of common transitivity pairs in Japanese, but there are a lot more.

|Translation|Transitive (subject)|Intransitive (object)|
|-|-|-|
|to open|開ける (あける)|開く (あく)|
|to close|閉める (しめる)|閉まる (しまる)|
|to turn on|つける|つく|
|to turn off|消す (けす)|消える (きえる)|
|to cut|切る (きる)|切れる (きれる)|
|to put in / to enter|入れる (いれる)|入る (はいる)|
|to take out / to leave|出す(だす)|出る (でる)|
|to drop / to fall|落とす (おとす)|落ちる (おちる)|
|to throw down / to fall down|倒す (たおす)|倒れる (たおれる)|
|to break|割る (わる)|割れる (われる)|
|to break|壊す (こわす)|壊れる (こわれる)|
|to begin|始める (はじめる)|始まる (はじまる)|
|to stop|止める (とめる)|止まる (とまる)|
|to lose / to disappear|無くす (なくす)|無くなる (なくなる)|
|to give a ride / to ride|乗せる (のせる)|乗る (のる)|
|to raise / to rise|上げる (あげる)|上がる (あがる)|
|to line up|並べる (ならべる)|並ぶ (ならぶ)|

>昨日新しいパソコン**が壊れ**ました。Yesterday my new computer broke.
>昨日新しいパソコンを**壊し**ました。Yesterday I broke my new computer.

One can see in the table that both transitive and intransitive can be a verb of either the 1 group or the 2 group, bet there are still some verb ending patterns (please note that they are **not valid in all cases**) which can be used to memorise pairs:

|Transitive ending|Intransitive ending|
|-|-|
|～る (消え**る**)|～す (消**す**)|
|～まる (閉**まる**)|～める (閉**める**)|
|～く (開**く**)|～ける (開**ける**)|

#### State of an object
If an **intransitive** (without a subject) verb is changed into its [ている-form](44) it will indicate a state of an object (e.g. a door is open at the moment). Be careful with transitive verbs because it will indicate an ongoing action (e.g. I am opening a door at the moment).
>ドアー**が**開**いています**。The door is open. (開く → 開いてる, が instead of を)
>ドアー**を**開け**ています**。I'm opening the door. (開ける → 開けている)

#### Result of an action
If a **transitive** (with a subject) verb is changed into its [てある-form](43) it will indicate a state of an object (e.g. someone has opened a door and it is open).
>寒いから、窓を閉めて**あります**。(It is cold, so I have closed the window)
