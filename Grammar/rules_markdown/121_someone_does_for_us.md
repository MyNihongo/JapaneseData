In order to say that someone does something for us (or literally *"someone receives from someone"*) a pattern `personに(から) + verbてもらう` is used. Please refer to the もらう (to receive) verb in [this article](165) for recap.
The pattern consists of a verb in its [て-form](52) and a verb *もらう* which means *"to receive"*. In its usage it is similar to [てくれる](118) which also means that someone does something us, but the key difference is:
- てくれる - someone takes initiative to help us
- てもらう - we take initiative and after that someone helps us

Therefore, *てもらう* is a softer way how to express the [causative form (～あせる)](99) and be grateful to someone who helps us even if it is us who takes initiative.
