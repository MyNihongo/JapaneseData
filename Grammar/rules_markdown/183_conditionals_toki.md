In order to put more emphasis on time when something happens (rather than on the action itself) a word `とき or 時` is used. And the complete pattern is `A(casual from)とき、B`. The clause A can be either in the present or past tense.

#### Present
>社長と話す**とき**、日本語を使います。When I talk to the boss I use Japanese.

The present tense describes a regular action which usually happens when the first clause (in this case *"社長と話す"*) is true.

#### Past
>散歩した**とき**、友達から電話が来ました。When I was walking in a park my friend called me.

The past tense describes when the second clause happened. Taking this example it is like answering a question: *"When did your friend called you?"*, so the answer is *"When I was walking in a park"*.
