In order to put more emphasis on time when something happens (rather than on the action itself) a word `とき` is used. And the complete pattern is `V(casual from)とき、B`. The clause A can be either in the present or past tense, but the usage might be tricky to grasp at first.

|Form|Usage|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Verb|V (cas.) + とき|食べる**とき**|
|Noun|N + **の**とき|勉強の**とき**|

#### Present
The present tense in *"A とき B"* is used when the action B happens before the action A.
>食べ**るとき**は、「いただきます」と言います。When people start eating they say "itadakimasu".

In the previous example people say "itadakimasu" and after that they eat, so the action after とき is performed before the action before とき.
The present tense is also used when the sequence of events cannot be determined, i.e. both clauses happen at the same time and there is no clear sequence what follows what.
>社長と話す**とき**、日本語を使います。When I talk to the boss I use Japanese.
>学校に行く**とき**、本を持っていきます。When I go to school I bring books.

#### Past
The past tense in *"A とき B"* is used when the action A happens before the action B, i.e. when the sequence is important. This usage is the counterpart of the present tense when the action B occurs before the action A.
>食べ**たとき**は、「ごちそうさまでした」と言います。When people finish eating they say "gochisosamadeshita".
>食べ**るとき**は、「いただきます」と言います。When people start eating they say "itadakimasu".
