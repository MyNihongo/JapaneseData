In order to say that something is done without doing something else a form `ないで` (casual) or `ずに` (formal) is used. *ないで* is created from the negative verb in the present tense with a syllable *で* (行く → 行かない → 行かないで). *ずに* is also created from the negative verb in the present tense, but the last *ない* is replaced with *ずに* (行く → 行かない → 行かずに).
