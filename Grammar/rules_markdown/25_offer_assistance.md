In order to offer someone your help a volitional [ましょう-form](24) must be used with a sentence-ending particle `か`. It is important to note that this form is not an extension of offering doing something, but offering your help to someone by doing something.

>手伝い**ましょうか**。May I help you?
>手伝**おうか**。May I help you?

The polite form is created by combining the verb stem and *ましょうか*, however, the casual form is the same as the volitional [ましょう-form](24), so it is not necessary to memorise it again. You can refer to the table below to repeat the form.
