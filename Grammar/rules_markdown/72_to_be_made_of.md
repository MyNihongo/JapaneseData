In order to say that something is made of something an expression `noun + から作る` or `noun + で作る` is used. These two forms of the expression are completely interchangeable, so there is no difference. Literally it is the active voice, so sometimes the expression is turned into the [passive voice](137) and becomes `noun + から作られる` or `noun + で作られる`.
>人間の成功が努力**から作られます**。A person's success is made of hard work.
>ジュースが果物**で作られます**。Juice is made of fruits.
