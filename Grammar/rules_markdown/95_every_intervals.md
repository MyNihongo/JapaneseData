In order to say that something occurs frequently at equal intervals a word `おきに` is used after a noun which specifies the length of the period. This expression can be applied to time, distance, etc.
>二年**おきに**日本に行きます。I go to Japan every two years.

### おきに and ごとに
The difference between おきに and [ごとに](269) is that ごとに defines the final point in the interval when the action starts, while おきに defines the interval between two actions. Let us take a look at the following example:

|Expression|Translation|Visualisation|
|-|-|-|
|2週間おきに|every two weeks|●○○●○○●|
|2週間ごとに|every second week|○●○●|

ごとに (every second week) implies that the action is performed after one week while おきに implies that between two actions there is the interval of two weeks.
