The sentence-ending particle `っけ` is used to indicate that the speaker is trying to remember something and seeks confirmation.  
Tense of a verb before っけ is determined by an action the speaker tries to remember. If the action was in the past then the past tense is used. On the other hand, if the action is about the present then the present tense is used.
