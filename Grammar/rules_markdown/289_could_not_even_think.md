The expression `まさか～とは思わなかった` is used to indicate the speaker's surprise that a certain event has occurred (i.e. the speaker had not thought that I would result in that outcome) and it can be translated as *"I could not even thought that"*.  
`とは` part is the short form of [というのは](TODO) which is used to introduce a subject.
