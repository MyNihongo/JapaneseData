The most basic way to ask a question in Japanese is to add a sentence-ending particle `か` to an expression.
>日本語ができます。I can speak Japanese.
>日本語ができます**か**。Can you speak Japanese?

In the casual context the sentence-ending particle *か* is rarely used, so instead it can be either dropped (however, intonation of an expression becomes higher at the end of it) or replaced by another sentence-ending particle `の` in order to emphasise a question.
>日本語できる？　Can you speak Japanese?
>日本語できる**の**？　Can you speak Japanese?
