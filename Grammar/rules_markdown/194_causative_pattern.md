The standard pattern for the causative form is `Aは + Bに + verbあせる`, but depending on whether a verb is transitive (を + verb) or intransitive (が + verb) this pattern may differ. Let us take a look at the patterns.

#### Transitive verbs
When transitive verbs (を + verb) are used an object of the causative form is used only with the に particle due to the grammar rule that two を particles cannot be used within the same clause.
>母は私**に**薬**を**飲ませました。Mom made me drink the medicine.
>母は私**を**薬**を**飲ませました。(✕) wrong grammar

In the first example the を particle is used only once, therefore, grammar is correct. However, in the second example the を particle is used twice, so grammar is wrong.

#### Intransitive verbs
When intransitive verbs (が + verb) are used an object of the causative form is used only with the を particle due to the fact that there will not be a next を particle since intransitive do not use it.
>母は私**を**学校に行かせました。My mom made mo go to school.
>母は私**に**学校に行かせました。(✕) non-Japanese way of saying

The second example might not seem bad at the first glance, but in this situation Japanese people do not use the に particle if there is a chance to use the を particle.
