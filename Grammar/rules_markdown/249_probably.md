The expression `はずだ` is used to express the speaker's belief about a fact that it must be true. はずだ can be translated as *"I think it should be the case"*. It should be noted that in this usage はずだ cannot be used to describe the own actions of the speaker.
Another usage of はずだ is to express the speaker's consent to a certain statement. For example when someone states a fact the speaker can agree by using はずだ (examples will follow).

|Form|Usage|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Verb|V (dic.) + はずだ|来る**はず**です|
|い-adjective|イA + はずだ|新しい**はず**です|
|な-adjective|ナA + **な**はずだ|きれいな**はず**です|
|Noun|N + **の**はずだ|日本人の**はず**です|

Please note that `はず` is usually not used when the speaker expresses his or her actions. Even though the meaning would be clear it sounds a bit unnatural in Japanese.
>金曜日までに、東京に来ない**はず**です。（✕）
>金曜日までに、東京に来ない**かもしれません**。(better)

In writing the special である form can be used for な-adjectives and nouns as shown in the table below.

|な-adjective|ナA + **である**はずだ|きれいである**はず**です|
|Noun|N + **である**はずだ|日本人である**はず**です|

#### Examples of expressing the belief (probability).
>A: 友達は学校に来ませんでした。The friend has not come to school.
>B: 寝ている**はず**です**よ**。He is probably sleeping.

Note that there is the [よ ending particle](189) which is an indicator that the speaker expresses the probability about a fact. If the よ particle is not present, it is likely that still the speaker is talking about the probability.
In the example the person A states the fact that the friend has not come to school, so the person B makes an assumption that the friend is sleeping. The person B assumes that it must be the reason why the friend has not come to school.

#### Examples of expressing the consent.
>A: 友達はずっと働いています。The friend is working all the time.
>B: そうですね。忙しい**はず**です**ね**。Yes, he is probably busy.

Note that there is the [ね ending particle](188) which is an indicator that the speaker expresses the consent.
In this example the person A states the fact that the fiend works all the time, so the person B agrees by adding that the friend is busy. The person B makes this assumption based on the fact that the friend is working all the time. The assumption plays the role of the consent of the person B.
