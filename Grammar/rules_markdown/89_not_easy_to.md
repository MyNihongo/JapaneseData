In order to say that for the speaker something does not go easy a pattern `なかなか + negative verb` is used. This expression implies that the speaker (or the subject of the clause) does his or her utmost to do something, but still it does not seem to work. Usually it is a noun which precedes the expression and it is important to conjugate a verb into the negative tense.
