The *て-form* is one of the most important grammatical points in Japanese. By itself it implies an imperative context in quite a straightforward and rough way, but it is also used in many other grammatical constructions, so understanding the *て-form* will be a stepping stone to understanding other grammatical constructions.
Nouns, adjectives and verbs have the *て-form*, but the rule for them is different and must be memorised.
### Nouns
Nouns must be followed by `で`.

|Type|Original|て-form|
|-|-|-|
|noun|日本人|日本人**で**|

### Adjectives
For い-adjectives the last い is replaced with `くて`, therefore, all adjectives in the negative form (all adjectives in the negative form end with い) have the same *て-form* with *くて*. な-adjectives have the same *て-form* as nouns, i.e. the last *な* is replaced with `で`.
*Note*: いい adjectives have a `よ-stem`, therefore, the *て-form* of いい adjectives is **よくて**.

|Type|Original|て-form|
|-|-|-|
|い-adjective|新しい|新し**くて**|
|な-adjective|きれいな|きれい**で**|

### Verbs
Verbs have the most complicated rules for creating the *て-form* where all verbs are divided into several groups with the same pattern of the *て-form*.
*する*, *行く* and *来る* have irregular rules which must be learned by heart. Forms of *る-verbs* and *す-verbs* are created from a verb stem (*ます-form* without *ます*) which is followed by *て*.  Forms of other groups are also created from a verb stem, but one more syllable is dropped and a special *て-ending* is added instead.
These groups are listed in the table below.

|Type|Original|て-form|
|-|-|-|
|する|する|**して**|
|行く|行く|行**って**|
|来る|来る (くる)|来て (**きて**)|
|る-verbs|食べる|食べ**て**|
|す-verbs|話す|話し**て**|
|く-verbs|聞く|聞**いて**|
|ぐ-verbs|急ぐ|急**いで**|
|う,つ,る-verbs|買う, 待つ, 帰る|買**って**, 待**って**, 帰**って**|
|む,ぶ,ぬ-verbs|読む, 遊ぶ, 死ぬ|飲**んで**, 遊**んで**, 死**んで**|
