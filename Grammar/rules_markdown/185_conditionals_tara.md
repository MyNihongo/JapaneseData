`たら` is the common conditional pattern which can be used in all cases except those covered in [と](90) and [なら](184).
`たら` can be used as both *"if"* and *"when"* depending on the context. To make the usage clear a word `もし (suppose)` is used in *"if"* sentences and the word is not used in *"when"* sentences. The `たら` form is usually used in the casual context, so in the polite context the [ば conditional](185) is used.
The pattern of the form is `Aたら、B`. Conjugate the A clause into the た-form (past casual) and add *ら*.

#### When
>東京に行っ**たら**、プレセントを買ってきてください。 When you go to Tokyo, please bring me back a present.

Since `もし` is not used this is the *"when"* sentence, therefore, it is known that this person will go to Tokyo.
By the way, *買ってきてください* is the [action towards the speaker](119).

#### If
>**もし**、東京に行っ**たら**、プレセントを買ってきてください。 If you go to Tokyo, please bring me back a present.

Since `もし` is used this is the *"if"* sentence, therefore, it is not known whether or not this person will go to Tokyo, but in case the person goes he or she is asked to bring back the present.
By the way, *買ってきてください* is the [action towards the speaker](119).
