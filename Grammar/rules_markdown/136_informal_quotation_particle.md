In previous topics about the reported speech (e.g. [と思う](133), [と言っている](164), [と聞いた](132), etc.) it was said that the *と particle* connects the first clause with the quotation verb. In the informal context the *と particle* is usually replaced with the `って` particle, so construction of the clauses remains the same.
