In order to report that the speaker heard something `そうだ` is used where the clause is in the casual form (both past and present tense are allowed).
そうだ implies that the speaker heard it directly from the person, so the the reported clause is 100% correct.

|Form|Usage|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Verb|V (cas.) + そうだ|食べる**そう**です|
|い-adjective|イA + そうだ|新しい**そう**です|
|な-adjective|ナA + **だ**そうだ|きれいだ**そう**です|
|Noun|N + **だ**そうだ|日本人だ**そう**です|

>明日、雨が降る**そう**です。I heard that it would rain tomorrow.
>日本の料理がおいしいい**そう**です。I heard that Japanese food was delicious.
>東京が静かだ**そう**です。I heard that Tokyo was quiet.
>ジョンさんは日本人だ**そう**です。I heard that John was Japanese.

A similar grammar for expressing the idea of *"I heard that"* is [らしい](277), but the difference is that そうだ implies that the speaker heard it directly from the original source of information, therefore, the probability for そうだ is 100%. らしい implies that the speaker heard it from someone else who is not the primary source of information, therefore, the probability is around 80%. 

#### "Heard that" vs "Looks like"
**Note** that そうだ can also mean [it looks like](106), but the patterns are different. *"I heard that"* uses the casual form while in *"it looks like"* the ending of verbs or adjectives is dropped.
>雨が降**る**そうです。I heard that it would rain.
>雨が降**り**そうです。It will rain in the next instance.

The first sentence (*"I heard that"*) has the dictionary form of a verb before it while the second sentence (*"looks like"*) has the verb stem before it.
