One of several ways of how to give advice is Japanese is the expression `たらいいよ` which can be broken down into three components. The first one is the [たら condition](185) then it is the いい adjective and the final one is the [よ final particle](189). So the expression can be translated as *"if A then it is good"*.

|Form|Usage|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Verb|V (た) + らいいよ|食べ**たらいいよ**|
|い-adjective|A (~~い~~) + かったらいいよ|新しかっ**たらいいよ**|
|な-adjective|A + だったらいいよ|きれいだっ**たらいいよ**|
|Noun|N + だったらいいよ|日本人だっ**たらいいよ**|

This expression has exactly the same meaning as [ばいいよ](217), but the difference is that ばいいよ is more often used in the formal context or writing while たらいいよ is used in speaking.
>漢字を勉強し**たらいい**です**よ**。It would be good if you study kanji.
>パソコンが新しかっ**たらいい**です**よ**。It would be good if the computer is new.

Please also do not confuse it with [たらいいな](218) (note that the ending particle is な) which is used to express the wish.
>漢字を勉強したらいい**よ**。It would be good if you study kanji.
>漢字を勉強したらいい**な**。I wish I could study kanji.
