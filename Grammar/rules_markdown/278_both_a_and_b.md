The pattern `も～し、～も` is used to introduce two clauses each of which has either the positive feeling or the negative feeling. It is not allowed to mix them, e.g. if the first clause is positive and the second is negative this sentence is ungrammatical for this pattern.
Previously we have learned [も～ば、～も](224) which also has exactly the same meaning and usage. Practically both these grammar rules are interchangeable.

|Usage|Example|
|-|-|
|N も V (cas.) し、N も|日本に**も**行った**し**、中国に**も**行った|
|N も イA し、N も|ひらがな**も**面白い**し**、カタカナ**も**面白い|
|N も ナA **だ**し、N も|ひらがな**も**簡単だ**し**、カタカナ**も**面白い|

When the form is used with verbs or in case there is a need to use another particle then `も` is placed after another particle.

>夏休みは大阪に**も**行った**し**、沖縄に**も**行きます。During my summer holiday I will do to Osaka and to Okinawa.  
>私のアパートは家賃**も**安い**し**、駅から**も**近いです。My apartment has a cheap rent and it is close to the station.

Depending on the situation the past tense can also be used before し and in the final clause.
>昨日は天気**も**よかった**し**、食事**も**おいしかったです。Yesterday the weather was good and the meal was delicious.
