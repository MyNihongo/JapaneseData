The expression `かわりに` is translated as *"instead of"* and is used to indicate only a temporary change, i.e. do instead of only this time, but the next time will be as always.

|Form|Usage|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Verb|V (cas.) + かわりに|食べる**かわりに**|
|Noun|N + **の**かわりに|日本人の**かわりに**|

>日本語を勉強する**かわりに**テレビを見ました。Only this time I watched TV instead of studying Japanese.
>なっとう**のかわりに**ラールンを食べました。Only this time I ate ramen instead of natto.

A similar word which also means *"instead of"* is [にかわって](242). The difference is that かわりに is just for one time, but にかわって indicates a replacement from now on. Let us look at these examples:
>社長**のかわりに**東京に行きます。I go to Tokyo on behalf of my boss only this time.
>社長**にかわって**東京に行きます。I go to Tokyo on behalf of my boss.

The first sentence (with かわりに) indicates that I will to go Tokyo only this time as an exception, but the next time the boss again will go to Tokyo. The second sentence (with にかわって) indicates that I will go to Tokyo on behalf of my boss all the time starting from now on, so the boss will not go to Tokyo any more.
