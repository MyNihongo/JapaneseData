In order to say that there is something and nothing more a word `ばかり` (sometimes is spelled as *ばっかり*) is used. In English it is translated as *nothing but* and it usually expresses a shock or surprise, sometimes in a negative way.

|Form|Usage|Example|

|Verb|verbて + ばかり|食べ**てばかり**です|
|Noun|noun + ばかり|日本人**ばかり**です|

>テレビを見て**ばかり**です。I do nothing but watching TV.
>テレビ**ばかり**見ています。I watch TV and nothing else.

Commonly ばかり is used only with nouns, but it is speculated that ばかり might also be used with verbs as well (so the form will be *て-form* of the verb + ばかり), but usually when a verb is used with *ばかり* another form is used and it is [ばかりいる](-1) which is another topic. Therefore, it is all right to use *ばかり* only with nouns for now.
