In order to list multiple actions where the order does not matter a structure `verb1 + たり、verb2 + たり、final verbたりする` is used. Each verb is in the casual form of the past tense. This form is appropriate, for example, for listing things which one does at the weekend.
There are changes in the *たり* consonant depending on the *て-form* of a verb. The changes are in the table below.

|て-form|たり-form|
|-|-|
|～て|～たり|
|～で|～だり|

Only the final *する* is conjugated, therefore, it determines the tense or intention of the whole list.
>今日は日本語を勉強し**たり**、映画を見**たりする**。
>昨日は友達に会っ**たり**、お茶を飲ん**だりした**。
