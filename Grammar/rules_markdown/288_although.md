The expression `ことは～が` has the meaning of *"but"* or *"although"*. The special use of this form is that the same verb or adjective must be used before and after `ことは`. However, with する verbs only the する part must be specified, i.e.:
- 勉強することはするが。 OK
- 勉強することは**勉強**するが。 ✕ (勉強 is repeated twice, it is not needed)

>なっとうはおいしい**ことは**おいしい**が**、毎日食べません。Natto is delicious, but I do not eat it every day.  
>JLPTは簡単な**ことは**簡単だ**が**、知らない言葉も出てきます。JLPT is easy, but there are also unknown words.

There are also the [が particle](171) and [けど](20) which also have the meaning of *"but"*, so the peculiarity of `A + ことは～が + B` is that it is used to say that the speaker understands the feelings behind the clause A, but for some reason cannot agree with it and states the opposite in the clause B.  
If we look at previous sentences and try to analyse the usage the following can be observed.

>JLPTに合格した**ことは**した**が**、日本人と話せません。I passed the JLPT, but I cannot speak with Japanese people.

In this sentence the speaker understands that the companion has passed the JLPT and has some knowledge about the Japanese language, but practically the companion is not ready for the real-world conversation.

>なっとうはおいしい**ことは**おいしい**が**、毎日食べません。Natto is delicious, but I do not eat it every day.

In this sentence the speaker understands that the companion thinks that natto is delicious, but for some reason the speaker does not want to eat them every day.

>JLPTは簡単な**ことは**簡単だ**が**、知らない言葉も出てきます。JLPT is easy, but there are also unknown words.

In this sentence the speaker understands that the companion thinks that the JLPT is easy and that the companion probably does not want to study or prepare for the exam, but this the speaker encourages to study because there might be unknown words.
