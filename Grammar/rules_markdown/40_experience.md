An expression `verb + ことがある` is used to talk about things which happen. The semantics of the expression depend on the tense of the verb, i.e. the present tense tells us about things which happen sometimes, whereas the past tense tells us about the previous experience.
#### Past tense
If a verb is used in the casual form of the past tense is followed by `ことがある` it means that the speaker talks about the experience, i.e. something which happened in the past. In order to say that something has never happened in the past the verb *ある* is conjugated into the negative form.
>東京に行っ**たことがあります**。I have been to Tokyo.  
>東京に行っ**たことがありません**。I have never been to Tokyo.

Note that it is not used for frequent actions (every day, every weekend, etc.) or for actions performed at a specified time (yesterday, last week, etc.). In these cases the *past tense* is used.
>**昨日**、ラーメンを食べたことがあります。（✕）Yesterday I ate ramen. (Performed at a specified time)  
>昨日、ラーメンを食べました。（OK）

>昼ご飯を食べたことがあります。（✕）I ate lunch. (Performed frequently)  
>昼ご飯を食べました。

#### Present tense
If a verb is used in the casual form of the past tense is followed by `ことがある` it means that the speaker talks about something what he or she usually does. In order to say that someone never does something the verb ある is conjugated into the negative form.
>自転車に乗る**ことがあります**。Sometimes I ride a bicycle.  
>自転車に乗る**ことがありません**。I never ride a bicycle.

Even though both ways are valid it is better to conjugate the verb before ことがありません to the negative tense and keep ことがあります as shown below.
>自転車に乗ら**ない**ことがあります。I never ride a bicycle.
