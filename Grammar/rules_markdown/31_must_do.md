The polite way of saying that something must be done is by using the [え-form](52) with one of three ending parts which conclude the *must do* sentences.
- *いけない(です)* - the speaker believes that there is no other choice (equivalent of *must*)
- *ならない(です)* - the speaker has an obligation to do something (equivalent of *have to*)
- *ダメ(です)* - neutral context (usually only casually)
>部屋を**掃除しなければいけない**。I must clean my room. (I understand that if I don't do it my room will be a trash)
>部屋を**掃除しなければならない**。I must clean my room. (I was told by someone, but I don't want to do it)

In order to say casually that must be done a `なくてはいけない` is used. This is the same form as [てはいけない](1), but it is in the negative form. The form *ないといけない* is created from the negative verb in the present tense plus *といけない* (meaning: cannot go like this), so an approximate translation into English might be *"if I don't do something then it cannot go like this"*.
>**就職しないといけない**。You must have a job.

In the spoken context a `なくちゃ`, `ないと` or `なきゃ` might be used. All three ending expressions might be used, but sometimes no ending expression is used at all (making the sentence very casual). One slight difference which might be noted is that *なきゃ* sounds more urgent than *なくちゃ*.
>部屋を**掃除しなくちゃ**(いけない)。I must clean my room.
>部屋を**掃除しないと**(いけない)。I must clean my room.
>部屋を**掃除しなきゃ**(いけない)。I must clean my room.
