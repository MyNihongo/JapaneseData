The polite way of saying that something must be done is by using the [え-form](52) with one of three ending parts which conclude the *must do* sentences.
- *いけません* - the speaker believes that there is no other choice (equivalent of *must*)
- *なりません* - the speaker has an obligation to do something (equivalent of *have to*)
- *ダメです* - neutral context (usually only casually)

>部屋を掃除し**なければいけません**。I must clean my room. (I understand that if I don't do it my room will be a trash)
>部屋を掃除し**なければなりません**。I must clean my room. (I was told by someone, but I don't want to do it)

In order to say casually that something must be done a `なくてはいけません` is used. This is the same form as [てはいけません](1), but it is in the negative form. The form *ないといけません* is created from the negative verb in the present tense plus *といけない* (meaning: cannot go like this), so an approximate translation into English might be *"if I don't do something then it cannot go like this"*.
>部屋を掃除し**なくてはいけません**。I must clean my room.

In the spoken context a `なくちゃ`, `ないと` or `なきゃ` might be used. The full form also contains いけない (e.g. なくちゃ + いけない), but it is also common to omit いけない at all.  
One slight difference which might be noted is that *なきゃ* sounds more urgent than *なくちゃ*.
>部屋を掃除し**なくちゃ**(いけない)。I must clean my room.  
>部屋を掃除し**ないと**(いけない)。I must clean my room.  
>部屋を掃除し**なきゃ**(いけない)。I must clean my room.

`なくちゃ` is the spoken て-form, where the last て is replaced by ちゃ. So *なくて* becomes *なくちゃ*.
`ないと` is the [if expression](90). For now it is all right to know that it is similar to the [ば-form](55). The *と* particle must go after *ない*.
`なきゃ` is the spoken negative て-form, where くて is replaced by きゃ. So *なくて* becomes *なきゃ*.

Please note that in the spoken context the word *いけない* is also in the casual form. Moreover, it can also be entirely omitted (therefore, it is in parentheses).
