In order to say that something is not mandatory to do or that there is no need to do something, a [てもいい-form](47) is used after a verb in the negative *て-form*.

|Form|Usage|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Verb|V (な) + くてもいいです|食べ**なくてもいい**です|

>お皿を洗わな**くてもいいです**。It is not necessary to wash dishes.

Another similar grammar is [ことはない](223) which also means *"you don't need to"*. Most people will say that these two forms are interchangeable, but there is a slight nuance. Let us consider the next sentences where the speaker says it to a person B.
>謝ら**なくてもいい**です。There is no need to apologise.
>謝る**ことはない**です。You do not need to apologise.

The first sentence (なくてもいい) implies that the person B has done something for which it is better to apologise, but the speaker by saying 謝らなくてもいい states that the person B does not need to worry about it. In other words, なくてもいい is used when there is a valid reason to apologise, but since it is not a big deal it is all right not to apologise.
The second sentence (ことはない) implies that there is literally nothing to apologise for. For example the person B did something (e.g. coughed) and apologised to the speaker. But actually there is really no need to apologise for it. In these cases ことはない is the best option.
