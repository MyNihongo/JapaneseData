### ごとに and おきに
The difference between ごとに and [おきに](95) is that ごとに defines the final point in the interval when the action starts, while おきに defines the interval between two actions. Let us take a look at the following example:

|Expression|Translation|Visualisation|
|-|-|-|
|2週間ごとに|every second week|○●○●|
|2週間おきに|every two weeks|●○○●○○●|

ごとに (every second week) implies that the action is performed after one week while おきに implies that between two actions there is the interval of two weeks.
