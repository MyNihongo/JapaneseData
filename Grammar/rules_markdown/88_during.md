In order to say that two actions which are performed by **the same** person happen at the same time an expression `ながら` is used. The *ながら-form* is created from a verb stem which is followed by *ながら*.
>音楽を聞き**ながら**、働く。I listen to music while I work.

It is **IMPORTANT** to note that the main action should be placed at the **end of the sentence** while the secondary action is at the start. The following two examples are grammatically correct, but convey different meanings.
>テレビを見ながら、日本語を勉強します。I study Japanese (main action) and watch TV (secondary action).
>日本語を勉強しながら、テレビを見ます。 I watch TV (main action) and study Japanese (secondary action).

`ながら` can also be used for longer periods (e.g. days, weeks, etc.). Consider this example:
>オリンピックも始まって、毎日寝不足になり**ながら**観戦をしています。The Olympic games have begun, so while I'm not getting much sleep I still watch the Games every day.
### Comparison to `間`
A similar way of saying *while* or *during* in Japanese is expressed by [間 (あいだ)](53), but there are two key differences:
- *間* may express two independent actions, while *ながら* implies that both actions are performed by the same person
- *間* is used in the continuous tense, while *ながら* has a simple tense

A way to remember how to use *ながら* is taking a point in time and verify whether or not there are two actions which are performed by the same person. *間* implies that two actions do not happen simultaneously, but *ながら* expresses exactly that two action occur at the same time. Take a look at the two examples below.
>A: テレビを見**ながら**、宿題をします。I watch TV while I do my homework.

>B: 宿題をする**間**、ずっとテレビを見てる。I constantly watch TV when I do my homework.

The A example implies that the speaker does a homework and watches TV at the same time, but the B example implies that the speaker gets distracted by a TV, stops doing the homework and starts watching TV, so two actions never overlap.
