In order to say that two actions which are performed by **the same** person happen at the same time an expression `ながら` is used. The *ながら-form* is created from a verb stem which is followed by ながら.
>音楽を聞き**ながら**、働きます。I listen to music while I work.

|Form|Usage|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Verb|V (~~ます~~) + ながら|食べ**ながら**|

It is **IMPORTANT** to note that the main action should be placed at the **end of the sentence** while the secondary action is at the start. The following two examples are grammatically correct, but convey different meanings.
>テレビを見**ながら**、日本語を勉強します。I study Japanese (main action) and watch TV (secondary action).
>日本語を勉強し**ながら**、テレビを見ます。 I watch TV (main action) and study Japanese (secondary action).

`ながら` can also be used for longer periods (e.g. days, weeks, etc.). Consider this example:
>オリンピックも始まって、毎日寝不足になり**ながら**観戦をしています。The Olympic games have begun, so while I'm not getting much sleep I still watch the Games every day.

Please also **note** that ながら cannot be used with **instantaneous** verbs, i.e. verbs which express the instant action (not an action with duration). For example verbs 見る (to watch), 食べる (to eat) or 聞く (to listen) have duration, while verbs like 乗る (to get on) or 降りる (to get off) are **instantaneous**.
>電車に**乗り**ながら、日本語を勉強します。(✕) I study Japanese while I get on the train.
>電車の中で、日本語を勉強します。(OK) I study Japanese on the train.

In the example above the verb 乗る expresses the instantaneous action, therefore, it cannot be used with ながら, so in this case it is better to use `の中で` to say that the speaker studies Japanese on the train.

### Comparison to `間`
A similar way of saying *while* or *during* in Japanese is expressed by [間 (あいだ)](53), but there are two key differences:
- *間* may express two independent actions, while *ながら* implies that both actions are performed by the same person
- *間* is used in the continuous tense, while *ながら* has a simple tense

A way to remember how to use ながら is taking a point in time and verify whether or not there are two actions which are performed by the same person. 間 implies that two actions do not happen simultaneously, but ながら expresses exactly that two action occur at the same time. Take a look at the two examples below.
>A: テレビを見**ながら**、宿題をします。I watch TV while I do my homework.
>B: 宿題をする**間**、ずっとテレビを見ています。I constantly watch TV when I do my homework.

The A example implies that the speaker does a homework and watches TV at the same time, but the B example implies that the speaker gets distracted by a TV, stops doing the homework and starts watching TV, so two actions never overlap.
