In order to say than an action occurs and as a result the action is directed towards the speaker a pattern `verbて + くる` is used.  It consists of two parts: [て-form](52) of a base verb and a verb *来る (くる)* which is written in hiragana, therefore, the pattern can be translated as *"to do something to come"*. This form is a counter part of [ていく](116) and, therefore, has exactly opposite meanings.
*て-form* does not conjugate, so in order to express a tense of the pattern only the last verb *くる* must be conjugated. Note that it is an irregular verb which conjugates as described [here](162).
This pattern is used in these situations:
- Do something and come back
- Something came
- Constantly do until now
- Gradual change of the state
#### Do something and come back
One of the first expressions which is taught in Japanese is `いってきます` which consists of the verb *行く* in its て-form with くる. So it literally means *"I will go and return to where I am now"*.
This can be used by both the speaker and other persons because a location which is meant by the verb *"to come"* is defined at the moment when the speaker says it. When the pattern is used by the speaker it means *"I did something and came here"*, but when the pattern is used by someone else it means that *"you do something and come to me"*.
>家に宿題を忘れ**てきた**。I forgot my homework at home. (lit. forgot and came here without it)

>女の人は仕事を終わっ**てきました**。I woman finished her work and came to me.
#### Something came
When an action is described with verbs for movement (e.g. to run, to drive, to fly, to fall, etc.) and a direction of the movement is towards the speaker the verb is supplemented with *てくる*.
>彼女は走っ**てきました**。A girl ran to from me.
#### Constantly do until now
Similarly as the present perfect continuous tense if an action was started in the past and is still performed in present the verb is supplemented with *てくる*. Usually the verb *てくる* is in the past tense, e.g. **きた**.
>五年間日本語を勉強し**てきました**。I've been studying Japanese for five years.
#### Gradual change of the state
In English an example could be *"it's getting hotter and hotter"*. So when the state of something changes gradually and the speaker is affeced by it (a change towards present), this change can be expressed with the verb `なってきた` (notice the past tense of the verb *来る*). The example implies that it is already hot, but it continues to get even hotter.
>寒くなって**きました**。It's starting to get cold.
