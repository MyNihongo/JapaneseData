In order to say that one has decided on something a form `noun + にする` is used. The form can be used with nouns without any changes, but in order to use it with verbs a verb in its dictionary form must be connected with the structure by `こと`, so the structure will look like `verb + ことにする`.

>今日はお茶**にします**。Today I decided to have a tea.
>これからもっと日本語勉強する**事にします**。From now on I decided to study Japanese more.

It has a similar meaning as [ことになる](76), but the key difference is that *ことにする* implies that the speaker has decided it by him- or herself, while *ことになる* implies that someone else decided it for the speaker.
>学校が好きだから、学校に行く**ことにします**。I like school, so I decided to go to school.
>学校がきらいですが、学校に行く**ことになりました**。I hate school, but it was decided that I would go to school.
