In order to contrast two sentences a word `けど` is used. Another way of saying *but* is by using a [word でも](6) which has the same meaning, but a grammatical difference is that *でも* is always used in the beginning of a sentence, while *けど* is used for connecting two clauses. *けど* can be used after nouns, verbs and adjectives.
*Note*: *けど* is usually used in the casual context.
>日本人だ**けど**、日本語で決して離さない。Although he is Japanese, he never speaks in Japanese.
>宿題をした**けど**、家にのを忘れ来た。Although I completed my homework I forgot it.
>今日は暑い**けど**、アイスクリームを買わない。Although it is hot I don't buy an ice-cream.
>試験が簡単だ**けど**、毎日勉強する。Although the exam will be easy, I study every day.　

It can be noted from the examples that casual conjugation is used before the *けど* word, so this is a proof that *けど* is a word of the casual context. However, there are two more formal derivatives of *けど* which are used in **casual writing** and these are `けれど` and `けれども`. It is speculated that *けれど* is more often used by women and *けれども* is more often used by men. A **formal** "but" in both speaking and writing is [が particle](171).

The last meaning of *けど* which also applies to the *が particle* is an introduction of a first part of a sentence before the main point, but the [んです-form](34) is used before the *けど* or *が* forms.
>手伝っていただきたい**んですけど**。I would like to ask for help, if it is possible. (very formal)
>日本人**んでうが**、この漢字の意味を教えてもらいませんか。So you are Japanese, could you teach me the meaning of this kanji?
