When a verb is modified with `かける` it implies the meaning that the speaker has started doing something, but has not finished it yet. In order to create this form add かける to the verb step as shown in the table below.

|Form|Usage|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Verb|V (~~ます~~) + かける|食べ**かける**|

>すしを食べ**かけ**ます。I have not finished eating sushi yet.
>すしを食べか**けま**した。I have not finished eating sushi.

Looking at both examples there is a slight difference between present and past tenses. present tense implies that the speaker is currently eating sushi and intends to finish eating soon. Past tense implies that the speaker is not eating sushi at the moment and left some sushi uneaten, so it is not so clear when the speaker intends to finish eating sushi (maybe there is no such intention).
