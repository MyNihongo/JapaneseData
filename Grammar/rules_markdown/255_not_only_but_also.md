The expression `A + ばかりでなく、+ B` is used to describe two qualities (A and B) and can be translated as *"not only A, but also B"*. This expression consists of the [ばかり](57) in the negative tense.
It is important to note that both A and B must be related. Otherwise if B introduces a completely different event it will not make much sense. Therefore, in the B clause the [も particle](172) is often used to indicate this relation.

|Form|Usage|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Verb|V (cas.) + ばかりでなく|食べる**ばかりでなく**|
|い-adjective|イA + ばかりでなく|新しい**ばかりでなく**|
|な-adjective|ナA + **な**ばかりでなく|きれいな**ばかりでなく**|
|Noun|N + ばかりでなく|日本人**ばかりでなく**|

It may be noted that when using `A + ばかりでなく、+ B` the clause B is considered more important than the clause A. This is the difference from [だけでなく](262) where both clauses have the same level of importance.

>富士山に登った**ばかりでなく**、京都にも行きました。Not only did I climb the mount Fuji, but also went to Kyoto.
>日本語の勉強が面白い**ばかりでなく**、楽しいです。Not only is studying Japanese interesting, but also enjoyable.
>東京メトロが便利な**ばかりでなく**、安いです。Not only is Tokyo metro convenient, but also cheap.
>あの人は日本人**ばかりでなく**、親友です。Not only is that person Japanese, but also my close friend.

As it was mentioned at the beginning two clauses must be related.
>あさみさんは漢字ができる**ばかりでなく**、文法**も**よくわかります。(OK) Not only does Asami can write kanji, but also understands the grammar.
>あさみさんは漢字ができる**ばかりでなく**、ピザ**も**食べる。(✕) Not only does Asami can write kanji, but also eats pizza.

The first sentence introduces Asami's Japanese abilities and both A and B are related to it, therefore, ばかりでなく is OK in this case.
However, the second sentence introduces two independent clauses, i.e. A - about Japanese abilities, B - about eating. At the first sight it is difficult to see the relation between the two clauses, therefore, ばかりでなく is not good in this situation.
