Previously there was an expression [でしょう or だろう](4) which indicated an almost certain probability of something. Another way of expressing a probability is by using `かもしれない` which imposes more uncertainty about something. The *かもしれない-form* is created exactly the same as the *でしょう-form* which is described in the table below.

|Structure|Form|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Verb|Casual form + かもしれない|行く**かもしれません**|
|い-adjective|Adjective + かもしれない|暑い**かもしれません**|
|な-adjective|Adjective + **な**かもしれない|静かな**かもしれません**|
|Noun|Noun + かもしれない|日本人**かもしれません**|

*かもしれない* is a constant expression, therefore, in order to change its tense a preceding structure must change its tense, but the form must be kept **casual**.
>明日雪が降らない**かもしれない**。It will probably not rain tomorrow.

Depending on the context *かもしれない* has three forms:
- かもしれません - polite.
- かもしれない - casual.
- かも - the most casual.
