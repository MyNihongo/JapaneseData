In order to say that something is not possible by any means (e.g. *"not at all"*) a pattern `全然 (ぜんぜん) + verbない` is used where the verb must be in the negative form. The word *全然* can be placed anywhere in its clause except at the end.
>箸で**全然**食べる事ができ**ない**。By all means I'm not able to eat with chopsticks.
