In order to say that something is not possible by any means (e.g. *"not at all"*) a pattern `全然 (ぜんぜん) + ない` is used where the verb must be in the negative form. The word 全然 can be placed anywhere in its clause except at the end.
>**全然**箸で食べる事ができ**ません**。By all means I am not able to eat with chopsticks.

However, in the contemporary Japanese 全然 can also be used with the positive tense so the meaning of the sentence becomes *"absolutely"* or *"for sure"*. One of the most commonly used expressions is shown below.
>**全然**大丈夫。It is absolutely OK!
