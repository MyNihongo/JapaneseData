In order to say that something does not change its state and remains as it is a word `まま` is used. The most frequently used Japanese expression with *まま* is `そのまま` which means *as it is*. Apart from this *まま* can also be used with verbs, nouns and adjectives and the patterns are in the table below.

|Usage|Form|
|-|-|
|Verbs|only ～た or ～ない + まま|
|Nouns|noun + の + まま|
|い-adjectives|い-adjective + まま|
|な-adjectives|な-adjective + まま|

The most peculiar usage is that of verbs while the other ones are standard. If a verb indicates a positive unchanged state then the verb must be in its affirmative causal past form (*た*), but if a verb indicates a negative unchanged state - in the negative casual present form (*ない*). This usage of tenses is the same as that of [ほうがいい](12), so that is how it can be remembered.
