In order to propose doing something in Japanese there are several forms.
### Negative verb + か
When a verb in the present tense and negative form is followed by a sentence-ending particle か (indicating a question) then the speaker offers doing something. A nuance of this expression is that the speaker is not completely sure about the response, so usually this form is used for brand-new proposals.
>お茶でもをし**ませんか**。Would you like to drink tea or something? (Formal)
>お茶でもし**ないか**。Would you like to drink tea or something? (Casual)

### ましょう
When a verb stem (*ます* form without *ます*) is followed by a `ましょう-form` it also introduces a proposal, however, this form is used for proposals which have already been asked for.
>レストランに行き**ましょう**。Let's go to a restaurant?

If the form is used in the formal context it does not conjugate, but in the casual context the form is different for *る-verbs* and *う-verbs*.
For *る-verbs* and exceptional verbs the final `る` is replaced with `よう`. Note a change how a verb *来よう* is pronounced.

|Verb|Example|
|-|-|
|食べる|食べよう|
|する|しよう|
|来る (くる)|来よう (こよう)|

For *う-verbs* the final `う` vowel must be replaced with a `～ぉう` where the last consonant and `ぉ` make a syllable. Relate to a conversion table below, but do not try to memorise it, the logic is the same for all verb groups, only a consonant changes.

|Verb ending|Proposal ending|Example|
|-|-|-|
|～う|～おう|歌う → 歌おう|
|～く|～こう|行く → 行こう|
|～す|～そう|話す → 話そう|
|～つ|～とう|待つ → 待とう|
|～ぬ|～のう|死ぬ → 死のう (**DON'T DO IT!!!**)|
|～ぶ|～ぼう|遊ぶ → 遊ぼう|
|～む|～もう|飲む → 飲もう|
|～る|～ろう|帰る → 帰ろう|
