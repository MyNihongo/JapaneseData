In order to give strict pieces of advice a grammatical structure `Verb + ほうがいい` is used. By *strict pieces of advice* it is meant that if a person does not follow it then there is likely to be a problem. In English it could be translated as "it would be better to...".
This grammatical structure is peculiar with regards to its affirmative and negative forms, i.e. when the form is affirmative a past tense is used, when the form is negative - present. In both cases the casual context is used.
The form can be written both in hiragana ("ほうがいい") or kanji ("方がいい").
>もう日本語を勉強したほうがいい。It'd better to study Japanese more.
>学校を休まない方がいい。It'd better not to skip school.
