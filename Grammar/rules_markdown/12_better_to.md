In order to give strict pieces of advice a grammatical structure `Verb + ほうがいい` is used. By *strict pieces of advice* it is meant that if a person does not follow it then there is likely to be a problem. In English it could be translated as "it would be better to...".

|Form|Usage|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Verb|V (た) + ほうがいい|食べた**ほうがいい**です|
|Verb|V (ない) + ほうがいい|食べない**ほうがいい**です|

This grammatical structure is peculiar with regards to its affirmative and negative forms, i.e. when the form is affirmative a past tense is used, when the form is negative - present. In both cases the casual context is used.  
The form can be written both in hiragana ("ほうがいい") or kanji ("方がいい").

>もっと日本語を勉強した**ほうがいい**です。It'd better to study Japanese more.  
>学校を休まない**方がいい**です。It'd better not to skip school.

According to the classic Japanese the verb in the affirmative form should always be in the past tense (た), however, in the modern Japanese it can be heard that the verb is just in the dictionary form.
>食べ**た**ほうがいいです。Previously the only correct option.  
>食べ**る**ほうがいいです。Is OK lately.
