The expression `わけだ` is used to express the speaker's consent when the speaker really understands the reason behind the statement. In other words when the speaker uses わけだ he or she expresses the understanding of the situation and consent.
Therefore, the [ね particle](188) is often used after わけだ (e.g. わけだね).

>A: 全然お金がありません。I have no money.
>B: それで、東京に来なかった**わけ**です**ね**。I see, that is why you did not come to Tokyo.

>A: 頭が痛いです。My head aches.

In both examples the person A mentions a problem and the person B reacts with わけ. So it means that the person B understands the reason of the problem which justifies why the person A was not able to do something.
わけだ is similar to [はずだね](249) which is also used to express the consent of the speaker, but the difference is that はずだね is more subjective while わけだ is more objective. In other words in terms of justifying the reason はずだね refers more to the speaker's feelings, but わけだ is related to a commonly accepted fact.
