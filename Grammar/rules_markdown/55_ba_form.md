The `ば-form` is not used only by itself, but it is part other grammatical structures, e.g. [ければならない](31) meaning "must do" or [if conditions](90). Verbs, adjectives and nouns have the *ば-form*, so patterns of the form are listed in the tables below.
*Note*: in order to memorise the form for い-adjectives and negative forms, remember that the final *い* is always replaced with *ければ*.

### Verbs
For all verbs (1 group, 2 group and 3 group) the rule is the same, i.e. for affirmative forms the final *う* vowel is replaced with *えば*, but for negative forms the verb is conjugated into the negative form in the present tense and the final *い* vowel is replaced with *ければ*.

|Tense|ば-suffix|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Affirmative|～えば|飲**めば**|
|Negative|～ければ|飲まな**ければ**|

More examples: する → する, 来る (くる) → 来れば (くれば), 食べる → 食べれば, 買う → 買えば, etc.
### い-adjectives
For affirmative い-adjectives the final *い* vowel is replaced with *ければ*. For negative forms the い-adjective is conjugated into the negative form in the present tense and the final *い* vowel is replaced with *ければ*.
*Exception*: the *ば-form* of いい-adjectives is **よければ** since the stem of いい-adjectives is *よ*.

|Tense|ば-suffix|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Affirmative|～ければ|高**ければ**|
|Negative|～ければ|高くな**ければ**|

### な-adjectives
For affirmative な-adjectives the final *な* syllable is replaced with either *ならば* or *であれば*. For negative forms the な-adjective is conjugated into the negative form in the present tense and the final *い* vowel is replaced with *ければ*.

|Tense|ば-suffix|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Affirmative|～ならば or ～であれば|静か**なら** or 静か**であれば**|
|Negative|～ければ|静じゃな**ければ**|

### Nouns
The *ば-form* of nouns is the same as the form of な-adjectives.

|Tense|ば-suffix|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Affirmative|～ならば or ～であれば|静か**なら** or 日本人**であれば**|
|Negative|～ければ|日本人じゃな**ければ**|
