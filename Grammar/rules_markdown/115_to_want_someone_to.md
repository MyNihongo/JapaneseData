In order to say that the speaker wants someone else to do something a pattern `personに + verbて欲しい`. Please note that the [に particle](175) is used to indicate the target person who is supposed to perform the action.
>友達**に**日本語を勉強し**て欲しい**です。I want my friend to study Japanese.  
>先生は私**に**宿題をやっ**て欲しい**です。The teacher wants me to do the homework.

If a part which specifies a person is omitted it would mean that the speaker wants the listener to do something.
>明日日本に行っ**て欲しい**です。I want you to go to Japan tomorrow.
