### Approximate point in time (ごろ)
In order to specify an approximate point of time a word `頃 (ごろ)` is used, so it can only follow words which indicate a precise point in time (e.g. 5 o'clock, Wednesday, July, etc.), therefore, when the speaker wants to mention a period a word `ぐらい` must be used instead.
>五時**頃**帰る。I return home around 5 o'clock.
>七月**頃**日本に行くつもり。I plan to go to Japan around July.
### Period of time in the past (ころ)
In order to indicate a period of time sometime in the past a word `頃 (ころ)` is used (*note* that the kanji character is the same, but its spelling has changed to *koro*). In English this expression could be written as *back in the days when...*, so it cannot specify a short period (e.g. *"Back in the days when I was eating spaghetti"* would sound weird in English as well) and often used to describe a childhood and similar periods of life.
