In order to say that someone completes something (transitive) or something completes (intransitive) verbs `上げる (あげる)` and `上がる (あがる)` are used respectively after the stem form of a verb.
This form is similar to the [終わる](96) verb, however, the difference is that *終わる* simply states the fact that an action is finished, while *上げる* and *上がる* mean that an action is performed properly until its full completion.
>昨日習った日本語の文法を復習し**上げました**。I have completed reviewing Japanese grammar I learned yesterday.
>日本の料理ができ**上がりました**。Japanese food is ready.
