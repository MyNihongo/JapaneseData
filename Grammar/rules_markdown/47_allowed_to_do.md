In order to say that something is allowed `てもいい` is used. The form is created from the [て-form](52) of a verb which is followed by *もいい*. An appropriate translation of this form into English could be "if something is done it's also all right".
This form is a positive counterpart of the [なくてもいい-form](32) which means that something is not necessary.
>ここでは走ってもいいです。It is allowed to run here.
>座ってもいいです。You may sit down.
