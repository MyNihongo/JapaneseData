In order to say *"it would be good if"* a structure `verbば + いい` is used where a verb is in its [conditional form ば](55) is followed by an いい-adjective (translates as *"good"*), so the expression literally means *"if A then good"*.
It can be used to express wishes of the speaker as well as a bit more imperative commands which could be translated with a word *should* (similar to `どうすれば`).
Examples how the expression is created with verbs are in the table below.

|Tense|Structure|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Affirmative|～えばいい|飲**めばいい**|
|Negative|～ければいい|飲まな**ければいい**|

>明日野菜を買え**ばいい**ですね。I should buy some vegetables tomorrow (It would be good to buy).
