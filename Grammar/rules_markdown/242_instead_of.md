The expression `にかわって` is translated as *"instead of"* and it is used just like it is used in English.
In some cases it can be translated as "*on behalf of*" (e.g. doing something on behalf of another person), but the meaning still remains close to *"instead of"*.

|Form|Usage|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Noun|N + にかわって|日本人**にかわって**|

>アメリカ**にかわって**日本に来ました。I came to Japan instead of the USA.
>漢字**にかわって**ひらがなで書きなす。I write in hiragana instead of kanji.
>社長**にかわって**東京に行きます。I go to Tokyo on behalf of my boss.

A similar word which also means *"instead of"* is [かわりに](274). The difference is that にかわって indicates a replacement from now on, but かわりに is just for one time. Let us look at these examples:
>社長**にかわって**東京に行きます。I go to Tokyo on behalf of my boss.
>社長**のかわりに**東京に行きます。I go to Tokyo on behalf of my boss only this time.

The first sentence (with にかわって) indicates that I will go to Tokyo on behalf of my boss all the time starting from now on, so the boss will not go to Tokyo any more. The second sentence (with かわりに) indicates that I will to go Tokyo only this time as an exception, but the next time the boss again will go to Tokyo.
