The expression `わけがない` is used to express a fact that the statement is absolutely not true. In the informal speech the が particle is usually omitted so the expression becomes just `わけない`.
わけがない is also similar to [はずがない](250), but the key difference is that わけがない is more like a fact (objective) while はずがない is used to express the speaker's belief (subjective).

>日本語がわからないと、JLPTを合格できる**わけがない**です。If you do not understand Japanese there is no way you can pass the JLPT.
>あの人日本人の**わけがない**です。That person is not Japanese.

#### Comparing わけがない and はずがない
As it was said earlier わけがない is more objective and はずがない is more subjective. Let us look at the sentence below.
>あの人日本人の**わけがない**です。There is no way that person is Japanese.
>あの人は日本人の**はずがない**です。I think there is no way that the person is Japanese.

Basically both sentences are equal, but notice *"I think"* at the beginning of はずがない. So it means that based on his or her knowledge the speaker believes that the person is not Japanese, however, these beliefs may not be common facts. In other words it is like the speaker makes an assumption of which he or she is absolutely sure.
On the other hand わけがない does not show any signs of the speaker's own beliefs, so わけがない is based on the common facts.
