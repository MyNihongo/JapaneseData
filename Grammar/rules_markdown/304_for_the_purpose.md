When the expression `には` is followed after a verb it has the meaning of *"in order to"* or *"for the purpose"*.  
には basically expresses the same idea as [ために](TODO), but the difference is that in `A + には + B` the clause A is often a certain purpose and the clause B is a requirement which is needed to achieve the purpose, therefore, an expression [必要がある](61) is often used in the clause B.  
Another peculiarity of には is that it is mainly used in speaking, so for writing [ために](TODO) is more appropriate.
