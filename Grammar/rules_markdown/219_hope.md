In order to express the wish or hope the expression `ばいいな` is used. It consists of three parts, i.e. [ば condition](186), いい adjective and [な final particle](191). Even though the expression is translated as *"if A then it is good"*, the な particle adds the meaning of desire and wish of the speaker.

|Form|Usage|Example|

|Verb|V (ば) + いいな|食べれ**ばいいな**|
|い-adjective|A (~~い~~) + **けれ**ばいいな|新しけれ**ばいいな**|
|な-adjective|A + ならいいな|きれい**ならいいな**|

This expression has exactly the same meaning as [たらいいな](218), but the difference is that ばいいな is more often used in the formal context or writing while たらいいな is used in speaking.
Please also do not confuse it with [ばいいよ](217) (note that the ending particle is よ) which is used to give advice.
