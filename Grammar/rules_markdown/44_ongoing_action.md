The Japanese form `ている` has many meanings which are listed below. This form is created from the [て-form](52) of a verb which is followed by a *る-verb いる*. In order to conjugate this form only the final *いる* changes its form. In the casual context the *い-vowel* is omitted so the form becomes `てる`.
>食べ**ています**。I am eating.
>食べ**ている**。I am eating.
>食べ**てる**。I'm eating.

The final *いる* can also turned into the *て-form* (for example with the *ておく-form*) which results in an interesting form where two *て-forms* follow each other.
>食べ**ていて**おきます。I am eating for the future.
>食べ**て**ておきます。I'm eating for the future.
### Current tense - now
Someone is doing something at this particular moment. In English it is an equivalent of the Present continuous tense.
>友達と一緒にアニメ見**ています**。I'm watching anime with a friend.
>宿題し**ていません**。I'm not doing my homework.
### Frequent action - habitually
Someone frequently does something as a habit, but it does not mean that someone does it at this particular moment.
>毎日日本語勉強し**ています**。I study Japanese every day.
>自転車乗っ**ています**。I ride a bicycle.
### State
In Japanese there are certain verbs which describe a state, so they must be used only with the *ている-form*. These are all [intransitive verbs](111) and `結婚する` (to marry), `離婚する` (to divorce), `瘦せる` (to loose weight), `太る` (to gain weight), etc.
>ドア**が**開い**ています**。The door is open. (開く is the intransitive verb)
>結婚し**ています**。I am married.
>瘦せ**ています**。I am thin.

Please note that the を-particle is replaced by the が-particle.
>本**が**書いています。(OK)
>本**を**書いています。(✕)

Please also note that a transitive verb will not indicate a state, but an ongoing action.
>ドアが開い**ています**。The door is open.
>ドアが開け**ています**。I am opening the door.
