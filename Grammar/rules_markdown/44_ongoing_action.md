The Japanese form `ている` has many meanings which are listed below. This form is created from the [て-form](52) of a verb which is followed by a *る-verb いる*. In order to conjugate this form only the final *いる* changes its form. In the casual context the *い-vowel* is omitted so the form becomes `てる`.
>食べ**ている**。I am eating.
>食べ**てる**。I'm eating.

The final *いる* can also turned into the *て-form* (for example with the *ておく-form*) which results in an interesting form where two *て-forms* follow each other.
>食べ**ていて**おく。I am eating for the future.
>食べ**て**ておく。I'm eating for the future.

### State
In Japanese there are certain verbs which describe a state, so they must be used only with the *ている-form*. These are all [intransitive verbs](111) and `結婚する` (to marry), `離婚する` (to divorce), `瘦せる` (to loose weight), `太る` (to gain weight), etc.
>ドア**が**開い**てる**。The door is open. (開く is the intransitive verb)
