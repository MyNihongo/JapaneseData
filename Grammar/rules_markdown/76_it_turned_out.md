In order to say that something has turned out to be the case an expression `verb + ことになる` is used. It must be noted that the expression implies that the speaker has no influence on the event, so it happened because the speaker could not control it. Usually the expression is never intended for the present tense and is used in the past (it has turned out) or future (it will be the case).
>日本語勉強するのが好きだから、テレビ見ない**ことになった**。I ended up not watching TV because I liked learning Japanese.

>そのままなら、困る**ことになる**。If it is like this it will cause you trouble.

### It has been decided
Similarly as [ことにする](36) the expression *ことになる* may have a meaning that something has been decided. However, the key difference is that *ことになる* implies it has been decided by someone else beyond the speaker's control, while *ことにする* implies that the speaker decided it by her- or himself.
>これから運動することに**する**。From now on I decided to do physical exercises.

>両親は綾子ちゃんが好きだから、私は綾子ちゃんと結婚することに**なった**。Since my parents like Ayako, it was decided that I will marry Ayako.
