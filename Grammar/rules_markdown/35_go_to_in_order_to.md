In order to say that one goes somewhere in order to do something the structure `placeに + verb stemに + 行く`. In order to change a context of this structure it is necessary to conjugate the last verb *行く*, so the remaining parts of the structure do not conjugate.
>日本**に**日本語を**勉強しに**行く。I will go to Japan in order to study Japanese.
>日本**に**日本語を**勉強しに**行きたい。I want to go to Japan in order to study Japanese.
>授業を卒業する後、日本**に**日本語を**勉強しに**行った。After I graduated I went to Japan in order to study Japanese.

Apart from the verb this structure can be used with nouns, so the meaning would be *"to go in order for something"*.
>日本**に**日本語の**勉強に**行く。I will go to Japan in order to study Japanese.
