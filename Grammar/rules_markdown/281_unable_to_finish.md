|Verb|V (~~ます~~) + きれない|食べ**きれません**|

Since `～きれない` is a verb it can modify nouns as it is shown in examples below.
>食べ**きれない**料理を冷蔵庫に入れます。I put in the refrigerator the food I am not able to eat.  
>JLPTが難しすぎたので、やり**きれません**でした。JLPT was too difficult, so I did not finish it.

～きれない is somewhat similar to [～かける](229) which also indicates that something is not completely done, but the difference is that ～きれない implies someone's inability to complete the action while ～かける simply states a fact that the action is not finished without specifying any possible reason.
>食べ**きれない**料理。Food I am not able to eat.  
>食べ**かける**料理。Food I have not eaten.

The first sentence (～きれない) indicates that the speaker has a full belly and he or she is physically not able to eat more.
The second sentence (～かける) simply states that the speaker has not finished eating and the reason is not know. Maybe the speaker will continue eating after a while.
