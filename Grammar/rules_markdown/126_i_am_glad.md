In order to say that the speaker is glad for something that occurred a pattern `verbて + よかった` is used. The pattern consists of a verb in its [て-form](52) and an い-adjective *いい* in the past tense, so the pattern means *"it occurred and it's good"*.
>綾子ちゃんが日本語能力試験に受かっ**てよかった**。I'm glad that Ayako passed the JLPT.
>日本語の文法を勉強し**てよかった**。I'm glad that I study Japanese grammar.
