In order to describe a current state as a result of an action in the past a `てある` form is used. In other words the meaning of this structure is that someone (e.g. not the person who speaks) has done something and it is still there, so the main point of the *てある-form* is the result itself while the action becomes secondary.

>レストラン**が**予約し**てあります**。The reservation in the restaurant is made.
>本**が**書い**てあります**。The book is written.
>もう払っ**てあります**。It's already paid.

In all the examples above the speaker simply describes the state of an object (it is done by someone else and it is there now).

Please note that the を-particle is replaced by the が-particle.
>本**が**書けてあります。(OK)
>本**を**書けてあります。(✕)

Please also note that *てある* is used only with [transitive verbs](111) (i.e. verbs which have a subject) and using *てある* with intransitive verbs is ungrammatical.
>ドアが**開け**てあります。(OK, 開ける is a transitive verb)
>ドアが**開い**てあります。(✕, 開く is an intransitive verb)
