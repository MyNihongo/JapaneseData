In order to describe a current state as a result of an action in the past a `てある` form is used. In other words the meaning of this structure is that someone has done something and it is still there, so the main point of the *てある-form* is the result itself while the action becomes secondary.
>レストランの予約し**てある**。The reservation in the restaurant is made.
>本**が**書い**てある**。The book is written.
>もう払っ**てある**。It's already paid.
