The expression `V (stem) + がたい` is used to indicate that the action described by the verb is almost impossible to do. がたい comes from the word [難い (にくい)](w2772730) which expresses difficulty in doing something. So basically がたい has the same meaning as [にくい](93), but the difference is that がたい implies more difficulty than にくい.
