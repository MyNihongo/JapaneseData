In order to say that one begins something starts a pattern `verb + 始める (はじめる)` is used (translation of the verb is *to begin* or *to start*). A verb which is modified with *始める* must be in its stem form.
In order to conjugate the whole expression only the helper verb *始める** is changed, so it defines the tense of the clause.
>昨日は日本語を勉強し**始めました**。Yesterday I began studying Japanese.
>雪が降り**始めます**。It starts snowing.
