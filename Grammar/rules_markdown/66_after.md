The form `た後で` is constructed from a verb in the casual context in the past affirmative tense which is followed by 後で which also means after. If a noun is used with 後で the noun must be connected by the の particle.

|Form|Usage|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Verb|V (た) + 後で|食べた**後で**|
|Verb|N + **の**後で|勉強の**後で**|

This form simply states the fact than one action is performed after another, so there is no obligation to finish the first action before the second one, i.e. when the order of actions is not so important. 後で does not specify how much time elapsed between to actions.
>日本語の勉強し**た後で**寝ます。After I study Japanese I go to sleep.
>日本語の勉強**の後で**寝ます。After I study Japanese I go to sleep.

#### 後で or 後
後で in *"A 後で B"* is used to describe that the action B follows right after the action A. However, *"A 後 B"* is used to indicate that the action B is true all the time after the action A is finished.
>帰った**後で**、本を読みました。After I came home I read the book.
>帰った**後**、**ずっと**本を読んでいます。After I come home I read the book all the time.

**Note** the difference in the tense. The first sentence (後で) simply listed two action performed by the speaker in the past. The second sentence (後) is in the present tense and is used to indicate what the speaker does when he or she comes home.
