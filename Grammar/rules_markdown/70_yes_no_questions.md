In the **casual context** when a **male speaker** wants to ask a question when an expected answer is either yes or no the *か sentence-ending particle* is transformed into `かい`. Note that this expression is used only with well-known persons, so its usage in the polite context is strictly forbidden.
>日本に行こう**かい**。Let's go to Japan?

>そのペンあげる**かい**。Will you give me that pen?
