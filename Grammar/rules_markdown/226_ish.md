|Verb|V (~~ます~~) + っぽい|食べ**っぽい**|
|Noun|N + っぽい|日本人**っぽい**|

っぽい can be used in these situations:
- *-ish* - usually with nouns, so in this case it tends to have a slight negative feeling towards the object (子供っぽい - childish, like a child).
- *colors* - when the colour is not exact it is used to define an approximate colour (白っぽい - something like white).
- *frequent actions* - usually with verbs, so in this case it just describes a tendency to do something (食べっぽい - eats a lot).
- *a lot of something* - usually used to talk when an object has a lot of something (水っぽい - there is a lot of water).

>30歳になりましたが、子供**っぽい**です。You are 30, but still like a child.
>黒**っぽい**車がほしいです。I want a blackish car.
>あさみさんはなっとうを食べ**っぽい**人です。Asami eats natto quite often.
