In order to express plans or intentions in a way *"I think I will do something"* a pattern `verbおう + と思ってる` or `verbおう + と思ってる` is used where the first verb is in the casual tense of the [volitional form](24) which is constructed by replacing the last vowel with *おう* and is translated as *"let's do something"*. Usually the pattern is **not used** in the negative tense, so for negations [つもり](49) is a more natural choice.
There are several ways how to express intentions and below the differences are explained:
- [つもり](49) - *つもり* is more certain. Even though *"verbおう + と思ってる"* shows that the speaker has been thinking about it *つもり* implies more determination
- [予定](140) - *予定* is a defined plan (e.g. plans for tomorrow or schedule), but *"verbおう + と思ってる"* expresses thoughts of the speaker to do something

This pattern can be used in two tenses which are show below
- *"verbおう + と思ってる"* - the speaker has been thinking about it for some time
- *"verbおう + と思う"* - the speaker just thought about it (the meaning becomes even less certain that *つもり*)
>運動し**ようと思ってる**。I've been thinking about doing some exercises.

It should be noted that with this pattern *と思う* can only be used to express thoughts of the speaker while *と思ってる* can express thoughts of both the speaker and third parties.
>綾子ちゃん英語を勉強**しようと思っています**。Ayako is thinking about studying English.
>(✕)綾子ちゃん英語を勉強**しようと思います**。Ayako just thought about studying English. (**WRONG**)
