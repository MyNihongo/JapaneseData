The expression `どんなに + A + ても、+ B` is used to express that the clause B is still true despite the clause A and is translated as *"no matter how much"*. The clause B can have either the positive feeling or negative. The first clause consists of a word [どんなに](w1009340) and the [ても form](127).
In case of the negative feeling it becomes similar to [のに](94) which expresses the regret of the speaker and inability to complete the clause B.

>**どんなに**日本語を勉強し**ても**、日本人と話せません。No matter how much I study I cannot talk to Japanese people.
>**どんなに**日本語が難しく**ても**、勉強し続けます。No matter how difficult Japanese is I continue studying.
>**どんなに**静か**でも**、集中できません。No matter how quiet it is I cannot concentrate.

As it was mentioned previously both positive and negative emotions can be expressed by "どんなに～ても". The first sentence expresses the speaker's regret that he or she still cannot talk to Japanese people despite all the effort. On the other hand the second sentence expresses the speaker's determination to study Japanese even though it is difficult.

### どんなに vs いくら vs たとえ
どんなに and [いくら](271) have practically the same meaning and they are easily interchangeable, but there is a slight nuance. どんなに expresses that the speaker have tried hard doing something ([頑張る](w1217700)), but いくら simply states that the speaker has tried doing it several times. For いくら it is not specified whether or now the speaker has tried hard.
