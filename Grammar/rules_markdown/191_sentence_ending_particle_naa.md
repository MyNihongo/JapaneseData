#### Rhetorical
The `なあ` particle is used when the speaker talks to him- or herself and does not expect other people to react to this statement.

>あの靴がきれいです**なあ**。These shoes are beautiful.

The example implies that the speaker likes the shoes and would like to buy them, but for some reason it is not possible. So these words mean *"I like those shoes, but I cannot buy them, so it cannot be helped"*. In this situation a response from the listener (if any) is not required.

#### Seek confirmation
Just like the [ね particle](188) and the [よね particle](190) `なあ` can be used to seek the listener's confirmation, but it sounds more harsh and masculine, so it is used mainly by men.

>あの靴がきれいです**なあ**。These shoes are beautiful, aren't they?.

Judging by the example above it might be said by a man who discusses the shoes with someone else and wants to confirm that the shoes are nice and maybe he would buy them.
