The word `ほど` has a broad range of usages, but the very basic meaning is *"to the extent"* where the speaker expresses his or her emotions.

|Form|Usage|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Verb|V (cas.) + ほど|食べる**ほど**|
|Verb|V (stem) + たいほど|食べたい**ほど**|
|い-adjective|A + ほど|新しい**ほど**|
|な-adjective|A + **な**ほど|きれいな**ほど**|

If the verbs are used before ほど the past casual tense (た) cannot be used.
>食べ**た**ほど。✕
>食べるほど。OK

Verbs are also often used in the [たい form](41) which expresses the speakers wish.

>涙が出る**ほど**かわいいです。It is so cute that I dropped a tear.
>何でも食べたい**ほど**お腹が空いています。I am so hungry that I want to eat anything.

Even though the English translation does not contain the expression *"to the extend"* there is still a comparison of the final clause to the feelings of the speaker (before ほど). For example the first sentence can be translated as "It is cute to the extent that I dropped a tear", but it does not sound so English.
