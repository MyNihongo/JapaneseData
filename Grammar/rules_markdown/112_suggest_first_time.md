When a verb in the present tense and negative form is followed by a sentence-ending particle か (indicating a question) then the speaker offers doing something. A nuance of this expression is that the speaker is not completely sure about the response, so usually this form is used for brand-new proposals.
In the causal context the か particle is not added, but the intonation goes up for the last syllable.
