The word `さすが` which can be roughly translated as *"live up to expectations"* has two meanings:
- compliment when something meets the expectations
- contradict when something does not meet the expectations

The first meaning (compliments) is the most commonly used. The word *さすが* can be used only by itself, with the *に particle* or with the *の particle*.
- by itself it is simply an exclamation (e.g. *"As expected!"*). When used 
- with the *に particle* it describes an action (i.e. verb) which is performed as expected
- with the *の particle* it describes an object (i.e. noun) which corresponds to expectations
#### Compliments
>綾子ちゃんは**さすがに**日本語能力試験に受かりました。As expected Ayako passed the exam.
>**さすがの**難しい日本語能力試験でした。As expected JLPT was difficult.
#### Contradictions
When *さすが* is used as a contradiction its more appropriate translation is *even*. Notice that in this meaning *さすが* is usually used with the *も particle* which emphasises the unexpectedness.
>**さすがに**綾子ちゃん**も**できなかった。Even Ayako didn't make it.
>**さすがの**日本の市民も、日本に行かせられません。Even Japanese citizens are not allowed to go to Japan.
