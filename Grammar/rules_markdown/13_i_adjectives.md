The first and very simple explanation of `い-adjectives` is that these are adjective which end with *い*. Even though it is the case for almost 100%, it is not always the case because an adjective *きらいです* is a [な-adjective](27) even though it ends with *i* before *です*. Therefore, a more valid definition of い-adjectives is that these are adjectives which are not derived from a noun. But it is all right to stick to the first definition for the time being.
*い-adjectives* are conjugated in the present and past tenses, in affirmative and negative forms. below is the standard conjugation pattern for い-adjectives.

||Affirmative|Negative|
|-|-|-|
|Present|～い (～いです)|～くない (～くないです)|
|Past|～かった (～かったです)|～くなかった (～くなかったです)|

Present tense:
>新し**い**。新し**いです**。It is new. (No changes of the dictionary form)
>新し**くない**。新し**くない**です。It is not new. (Replace the final い with くない)

Past tense:
>新し**かった**。新し**かった**です。It was new. (Replace the final い with かった)
>新し**くなかった**。新し**くなかった**です。It was not new. (Replace the final い with くない, and replace the new final い with かった)

Except one case all い-adjectives are regular and follow the aforecited pattern, however, the only exception is the `いい-adjectives` (*いい* means *good* in Japanese). Basically the only difference is that the first い is replaced with よ, otherwise the pattern remains the same. The pattern for *いい-adjectives* is described below.
Present tense:
>いい。いいです。It is good. (No changes of the dictionary form)
>よくない。よくないです。It is not good. (Change the first い to よ, replace the final い with くない)

Past tense:
>よ**かった**。よ**かった**です。It was good. (Change the first い to よ, replace the final い with かった)
>よ**くなかった**。よ**くなかった**です。It was not good. (Change the first い to よ, replace the final い with くない, and replace the new final い with かった)

In order to use a verb with a な-adjective a dictionary form of this verb must be connected with an adjective by a `の particle`.
>日本語を勉強する**のが**難しいです。Studying Japanese is difficult.
