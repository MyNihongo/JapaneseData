The `よね` particle just like the [ね particle](188) seeks the listener's confirmation and usually these two particles are interchangeable. However, the small difference is that with `よね` the speaker is less confident about the listener's confirmation, so it is more like a subjective opinion of the speaker.

#### よね example
>このケーキが美味しいです**よね**。This cake is delicious, isn't it?

In the example the cake is delicious to the speaker, however, the speaker is not sure whether or not the cake is delicious to the listener as well. Therefore, the speaker used `よね`.

#### ね example
>このケーキが美味しいです**ね**。This cake is delicious, isn't it?

In this example both the speaker and the listener probably have a similar taste, so the speaker is quite confident that the cake is delicious to the listener as well. Therefore, the speaker used `ね`.
