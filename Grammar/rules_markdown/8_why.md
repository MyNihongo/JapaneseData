In Japanese there are three common ways to ask for a reason (*why* question word in English):
- `なぜ` - ask for a reason or cause;
- `どうして` - ask for a reason or cause. Ask for a method (how);
- `なんで` - ask for a reason or cause. Ask for a method (how).

*なぜ* has the smallest scope (only why), but *どうして* and *なんで* have the same meaning and are interchangeable in any context (formal or casual).
Examples of asking for a reason (all there forms are used):
>**なぜ**日本語を勉強するの。Why do you learn Japanese?
>**どうして**日本語を勉強するんですか。Why do you learn Japanese?
>**なんで**日本語を勉強するの。Why do you learn Japanese?

Examples for asking for a method (only *どうして* and *なんで*):
>**どうして**そのご飯を支度しましたか。How did you prepare this meal?
>**なんで**そのご飯を支度しましたか。How did you prepare this meal?
