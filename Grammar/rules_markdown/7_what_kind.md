In order to ask about some objects a question word `どんな` is used. Its English equivalent might be *what kind of* or *what sort of*.

>**どんな**アニメ好きですか。 What kind of anime do you like?
>ここには**どんな**食べ物がありますか。What kind of food is there?

Regarding this question it is often confused with `何の` which literally means *"what"*. Since *どんな* means *what kind of* it is used for qualities of an object (adjectives), but *何の* is used for the name of an object.

>**何の**アニメ好きですか。 What anime do you like?
>ここには**何の**食べ物がありますか。What food is there?

Let us answer the question about food with *どんな* and *何の* and see the difference in answers to the question.

>**どんな**食べ物がありますか。What kind of food is there?
>安くて、おいしい食べ物です。Cheap and tasty food.

>**何の**食べ物がありますか。What kind of food is there?
>おすしとラーメンです。Sushi and ramen.

In response to *どんな* the answer was about the characteristics of the food whereas in response to *何の* certain names of products are named.
