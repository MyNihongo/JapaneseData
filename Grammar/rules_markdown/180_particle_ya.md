The `や` particle connects nouns with a word *"and"*, e.g. ケイタイやペン (mobile phone and pen). Unlike the [と particle](179) the `や` particle implies that there are more items which are omitted in the list.

>鞄にケイタイ**や**ペンがあります。In my bag there is a phone and a pen. (and something else)

When there are several items mentioned at the end of the list usually there is the `など` particle which can be translated as *"and stuff like that"*.

>鞄にケイタイ**や**ペン**など**があります。In my bag there is a phone, pen and stuff like that.
