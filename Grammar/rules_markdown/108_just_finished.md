In order to say that something has just finished, i.e. the time span between present and when something finished is short according to the speaker (however, in reality the time span **may be long**), a form `verbた + ばかり` is used. The form is constructed from a verb in the past casual tense which is followed by a word ばかり.

|Form|Usage|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Verb|V (た) + ばかり|食べた**ばかり**です|

>今なら、いいです。起きた**ばかり**です。If now it's OK. I just woke up.

This form is quite similar to [たところだ](109), however, the difference is that たばかり indicates the speaker's feeling (reality may differ), but たところだ indicates the real time span.
>授業が始まった**ばかり**です。Studies have just begun.
>授業が始まった**ところ**です。Studies have just begun.

The first sentence (たばかり) states that the speaker feels like the studies have just begun, however, in reality it might be a month or year since the beginning.
The second sentence (たところ) states that it has been like one day since the studies began, so literally the time span is short.
