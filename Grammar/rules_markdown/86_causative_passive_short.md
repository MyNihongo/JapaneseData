The [causative passive form させられる](100) is quite long, so in order to simplify its usage there is a special short form which can only be applied to the verbs in the first group. Furthermore, verbs in the first group which end with す (話す、出す、試す、etc.) **cannot** be used with the short form.
The short form like the complete form starts with the ない-form of the verb without ない (e.g. 買う → 買わない → 買わ), but the ending is `される`. Conjugation of all groups is shown in the table below.
