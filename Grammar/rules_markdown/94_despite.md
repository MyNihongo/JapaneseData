In order to say a but-sentence in the past tense with a frustration or surprise in a positive way a `のに` particle is used. This structure implies a strong feeling of the speaker towards this outcome. Please note that `のに` is mostly used for actions in **the past** whereas [ても](127) is used for actions in present or future. In some situations the [continuous ている](44) may also be used.
In English its usage can be translated as *even though* or *in spite of*.
