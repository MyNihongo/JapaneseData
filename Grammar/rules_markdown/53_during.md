### 間 (あいだ)
In order to say that one does something **all the time during a certain period** a word `間` is used, so the pattern of the form is `A + 間、B` and it means that the event A has **the same duration** as the event B.

|Usage|Example|
|-|-|
|verb + 間|食べている**間**|
|noun + **の**間|大学**の間**|

Due to the continuous tense of the form the second action is usually used with *ずっと* which means *continuously or constantly*. There are several grammatical points of this form:
- Both actions are used in the continuous [ている-form](44). If the first verb is not an action verb (e.g. *ある* or *いる*) the continuous tense is not used.
- The first action (A) is **always** in the present tense even if the second action (B) is in the past. So the second action determines the tense of the whole sentence.
- If *間* is used with a noun the *の particle* connects the noun and *間*.
>テレビを見ている**間**、ずっと何か食べています。While I watch TV I constantly eat something.
>家にいる**間**、ずっと用事をしています。While I am at home I continuously do my chores.
>宿題をしている**間**、音楽を聞い**ていました**。While I was doing my homework I was listening to music.
>大学生**の間**、お金がなかったです。While I was a student I had no money.

The main distinction from [ながら](88) is the fact that *間* implies that two actions do not happen simultaneously, but in case of *ながら* two action occur at the same time. The second clause of *間* may also express not an action, but a prohibition, while *ながら* always has two actions.

### 間に (あいだに)
When there are still two events which happen at the same time, but a duration of one event is **shorter** than that of another event the `間に` is used where `A + 間に、B` indicates that the event B is shorter that the event A (B started after A and finished before A).

|Usage|Example|
|-|-|
|verb + 間に|食べている**間に**|
|noun + **の**間に|大学**の間に**|

Another peculiarity of *間に* is that the second event is usually outside the control of the subject in the first event.
>宿題をしている**間に**、友達が来ました。While I was doing my homework a friend came.
>冬休み**の間に**、新しい漢字をたくさん覚えました。I learned many new kanji characters while I was on my winter holidays.
