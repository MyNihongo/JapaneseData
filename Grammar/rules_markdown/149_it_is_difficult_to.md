In order to say that something is difficult to do a pattern `verb + づらい(です)` is used. The pattern is constructed from a verb stem which is followed by an い-adjective づらい which means *"difficult"* or *"hard"*, therefore, the whole pattern is treated as an **い-adjective**.

|Pattern|Example|
|-|-|
|verb stem + やすい|食べ**づらい**です|

It has a similar meaning as [にくい](93), but the key difference is that *にくい* sounds more objective than *づらい*, i.e. *にくい* is used for actions which are generally difficult, but *づらい* is used in the scope of an individual.
>その漢字は覚え**づらい**です。It's difficult for me to memorise that kanji.
