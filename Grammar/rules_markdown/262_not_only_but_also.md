The expression `A + だけでなく、+ B` is used to describe two qualities (A and B) and can be translated as *"not only A, but also B"*. This expression consists of the [だけ](3) in the negative tense.
It is important to note that both A and B must be related. Otherwise if B introduces a completely different event it will not make much sense. Therefore, in the B clause the [も particle](172) is often used to indicate this relation.

|Usage|Example|
|-|-|
|V (dic.) + だけでなく|食べる**だけでなく**|
|イA + だけでなく|新しい**だけでなく**|
|ナA + **な**だけでなく|きれいな**だけでなく**|
|N + だけでなく|日本語**だけでなく**|

>富士山に登った**だけでなく**、京都にも行きました。Not only did I climb the mount Fuji, but also went to Kyoto.
>日本語の勉強が面白い**だけでなく**、楽しいです。Not only is studying Japanese interesting, but also enjoyable.
>東京メトロが便利な**だけでなく**、安いです。Not only is Tokyo metro convenient, but also cheap.
>あの人は日本人**だけでなく**、親友です。Not only is that person Japanese, but also my close friend.

In the written form the special である form can be used for な-adjectives and nouns as follows.
>東京メトロが便利**である**だけでなく、安いです。Not only is Tokyo metro convenient, but also cheap.
>あの人は日本人**である**だけでなく、親友です。Not only is that person Japanese, but also my close friend.

It may be noted that when using `A + だけでなく、+ B` both clauses are considered of the same importance. This is the difference from [ばかりでなく](255) where the clause B is more important than the clause A.
