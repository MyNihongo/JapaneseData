When the suffix `～込む` is attached to the stem of a verb it may have two meanings:
- *"to go inside"* - action which indicates a movement inside
- *"to do for a long time"* - action which indicates a long duration

Practically it is not like it can be attached to any verb and there are already commonly used verbs for both of these meanings:
- [入り込む (to go into)](w1465460), [書き込む (to fill in)](w1343730), [乗り込む (to board in)](w1354910), etc.
- [話し込む (to be deep in talk)](w1562320), [落ち込む (to feel down)](w1548570), etc.

>一人でJLPTの申し**込み**を書き**込み**ました。I filled in the JLPT application by myself.  
>そんなに落ち**込む**ことはないです。There is no need to feel down.

The first sentence has the meaning of *"going inside"* when the speaker filled in the application it was like the information went into the paper. By the way, the word [申し込み](w1605140) also has the 込み prefix and it also indicates the movement, since when the speaker applies for something the application form moves somewhere.  
The second example has the meaning of *"doing for a long time"*, so when [落ち込む](w1548570) is used it indicates that someone is feeling down for some time, not just at this particular moment.
