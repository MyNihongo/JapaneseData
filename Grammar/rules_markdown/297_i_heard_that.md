The expression `んだって` is used to report someone's words and can be translated as *"I heard that"*. It has exactly the same meaning as [そうだ](110) when something was heard directly from the source. The difference of んだって is that it is very casual and must be used only with friends, while そうだ is a polite form which can be used in official conversations.  
This expression consists of the [んです form](34) and a word [だって](w2643970) which is translated as *"I hear"*.

>あさみがJLPTに合格した**んだって**。I heard that Asami had passed the JLPT.  
>あのレストランは値段も安いし、料理もおいしい**んだって**。I heard that that restaurant had cheap prices and delicious food.  
>あの人は日本人な**んだって**。I heard that that person was Japanese.

It is also possible to omit the ん from んだ so only だって will remain.
>あさみがJLPTに合格した**だって**。I heard that Asami had passed the JLPT.

Since there is the [んだ form](34) it might be tempting to transform んだって to んですって in order to make a polite form, but it does not work like this. Even though んですって is a valid form in the modern Japanese it is used only by women in their 50-60ies. So it will be quite confusing is men or young people use it.
