In order to express the idea of wishing to do something, but not actually being able to do it the expression `V にも V できない` is used where the verb is the same in both places. It can be translated as *"I would like, but cannot"*.
The form of the first verb is the short [volitional form](24) and the second verb is in the negative [potential form](97). The usage for 3 verb groups is shown down below.

|Group|Usage|Example|
|1 group|V + にも + V (できない)|行こう**にも**行け**ません**|
|2 group|V + ようにも + V (れない)|食べよう**にも**食べれ**ません**|
|3 group|する|しよう**にも**でき**ません**|
|3 group|くる|こよう**にも**これ**ません**|

>日本人に会おう**にも**会え**ません**。I would like to meet with Japanese people, but I cannot.
>日本語を勉強しよう**にも**できません。I would like to study Japanese, but I cannot.

Let us look at the second example. When する verbs are used in order to make the sentence shorter for the second it is acceptable to omit the whole verb and leave only the する verb itself which becomes できる. It is all right since the verb has already been mentioned before, so there is no need to repeat it again.
