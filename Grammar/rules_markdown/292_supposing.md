The expression `もしも～たら` is used as a conditional clause and is translated as *"supposing"*.

|Form|Usage|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Verb|もしも + V (た) + ら|**もしも**食べ**たら**|

>**もしも**JLPTに合格し**たら**、就職を申し込みます。Supposing that I pass the JLPT I will apply for work.  
>**もしも**たくさん漢字を覚え**たら**、この本を読めます。Supposing that I memorise many kanji I will be able to read this book.

In the [たら conditional form](185) it was said that `もし～たら` is used quite often to indicate the meaning of *"if"*, so the difference is only in もしも and もし and there is a slight nuance when each of them is used.
- もし: indicates a general if condition
- もしも: indicates an if condition with a little bit of imagination

もし is used more as a fact while もしも tends to state a desire. Let us look at two sentences below.
>**もし**日本に行っ**たら**、なっとうを思いっ切り食べます。If I go to Japan I will eat a lot *of natto.  
>**もしも**日本に行っ**たら**、なっとうを思いっ切り食べます。Supposing that I go to Japan I will eat a lot *of natto.

The first sentence (もし) simply states a fact that if the speaker goes to Japan he or she will eat natto.  
The second sentence (もしも) implies that the speaker is imagining going to Japan and what he or she might do there in this case.
