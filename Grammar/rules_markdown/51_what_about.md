In order to ask for an opinion about something (i.e. English for *"how about"*) in Japanese a question-ending word `どうですか` is used. An important note is that is can be used **only** after nouns, so in order to use it with a verb the verb must be turned into the *～ing form*, i.e. adding a *の particle* to the dictionary form of the verb.
>明日は**どうですか**。What about tomorrow?
>東京に行くのは**どうですか**。What about going to Tokyo?
>日本語の勉強は**どうですか**。How are your Japanese studies going?

In the past tense this structure is used to ask about things which were done in the past.
>昨日、日本語の勉強はどう**でした**か。How was your Japanese study yesterday?
