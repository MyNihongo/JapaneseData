In order to say that one finishes something a pattern `verb + 終わる (おわる)` is used which literally means *"to end"* or *"to finish"*. It is a counterpart of [verb + 始める](65) and the form is created in the exactly same way, i.e. a verb stem is followed by *終わる*.
>今日は働き**終わった**。I've finished working for today.

>友達が着替え**終わる**まで時間がある。We have some time until our friend finishes changing clothes.
