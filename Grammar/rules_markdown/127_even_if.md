In order to talk about something hypothetically by using a structure *"even if"* or *"no matter what"* a pattern `て-form + も + negative` is used. Please note `Aても、Bない` is a set pattern where the negative form follows `ても`.
Meaning of this pattern is similar to [のに](94), but *のに* is used to express frustration about something that has already happened while *ても* implies that an action is hypothetical. As opposed to *のに* the *ても-form* cannot end a sentence and there must always be a next clause after *ても*.
