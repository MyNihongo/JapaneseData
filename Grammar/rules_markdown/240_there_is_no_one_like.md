The expression `A + ほど + B (ない)` means that there is no such B which could match A. In other words it means that A is the best.
This form is a more formal equivalent of [くらい～ない](241) since くらい is usually for speaking while ほど can be used in both speaking and writing.

|Form|Usage|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Noun|N + ほど～ない|日本人**ほど**人がい**ない**|

>英語ができる人が多くいますが、日本語ができる人**ほど**はいま**せん**。There a many people who know English, but not as much as people who know Japanese.
>あさみさん**ほど**日本語ができる人**はいません**。There is no such person who know Japanese like Asami.

## Comparison of adjectives
`ほど～ない` can also act as [より](50) when adjectives are compared. In this case ほど～ない implies that between two objects the difference is small, but the object which is modified with ほど is more than another object.
Let us write the sentence *"Tokyo is bigger than Sapporo"* by using ほど～ない and より.
>東京は札幌**より**大きいです。Tokyo is bigger than Sapporo.
>札幌は東京**ほど**大きく**ない**です。Sapporo is not bigger than Tokyo.

There are two differences between two sentences. But still despite the change of the form the meanings of the sentences are the same.
- 東京 and 札幌 are swapped
- 大きい changed to 大きくない
