In order to list several examples of something the `とか` particle is  used to connect nouns or verbs. Its meaning is similar to the [や particle](180) where several but not all items are listed, but semantics of *とか* is different in a way that all items of *とか* are meant as an example (so they are a bit more vague), but items of *や* are real items (not vague). To put it simply *とか* is often translated as *like (e.g. places like that, food like that, etc.)*, so it emphasises that these items are just examples.
*とか* can be used **only** in speaking.
