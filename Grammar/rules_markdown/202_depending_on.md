When `によって` follows a noun this can be translated as *"depending on"* and it is used only with nouns, so the whole pattern *"A によって B"* is translated as *"depending on A, B"* where A is the noun and B is the fact which is different.  
によって in [A + によって + B](306) can also mean *"by means of"*, so the difference in usages can only be known from the actual context.

|Form|Usage|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Noun|N + によって|国**によって**|

Since this expression implies that there is a difference depending on the noun (clause A) a verb which is frequently used in the B clause is `違う (ちがう)` which means *"to differ"*. The pattern for these sentences is *"A によって B が違う"*. Please note that there is the が particle after B.

>人**によって**好物**が**違います。
