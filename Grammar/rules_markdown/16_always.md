In order to express an idea that something happens all the time a word `いつも` is used. Touching upon similar semantics the expression *いつも* conveys an idea that an action occurs regularly or is performed habitually.

>**いつも**文句を言います。He always complains.
>**いつも**の事通りあさみさんがきれいです。Asami is beautiful as always.
>仕事の後は**いつも**運動しています。I always do physical exercises after work.

Note that the last sentence is in the [continuous tense](44) which implies that the action is performed regularly. The first sentence is in the present tense which means that it simply states the fact.
