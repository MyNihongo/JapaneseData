In order to say that something or someone is similar to another object or person by **characteristics** an い-adjective `らしい` is used. A similar expression was [みたいな](83), but the key difference is that *みたいな* is similar by appearance (outer), but *らしい* - by characteristics (inner).
*らしい* can be conjugated into a negative form or an adverb.

|Form|Usage|Example|
|-|-|-|
|い-adjective|イA + らしい|新しい**らしい**です|
|な-adjective|ナA + らしい|きれい**らしい**です|
|Noun|N + らしい|日本人**らしい**です|

>あさみさん**らしい**人が好きです。I like persons like Asami.
>田中さんは山田先生**らしく**説明しました。Tanaka explained like Yamada teacher.

#### "Heard that" vs "Looks like"
**Note** that らしい can also mean [I heard that](277). Due to the fact that the form is identical the difference can be spotted only by the context.
>あさみさんは日本人**らしい**人です。Asami is like a Japanese person.
>明日は休み**らしい**です。Tomorrow is a day off.

The first sentence (*"looks like"*) describes Asami's characteristics that she is like a Japanese person while the second sentence (*"I heard that"*) states that tomorrow is a day off. Looking at the translations it is clear that the topics of these two sentences are completely different.
