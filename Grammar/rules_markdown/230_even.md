The pattern `さえ + ない` is translated as *"even"* and expresses that the speaker cannot do or have not done even something so simple.

|Form|Usage|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Noun|N + さえ|日本語さえ|
|Noun|N + (particle) + さえ|日本人とさえ|

>ひらがな**さえ**読めません。I cannot read even hiragana.
>友達に**さえ**合いませんでした。I did not meet even with friends.

さえ can also be used with all particles with modify nouns before さえ as it is shown in the second example sentence. In this case the particle is places between the noun and さえ.
さえ can replace such particles as を, が and も, therefore, these particles are omitted when さえ is used.
>なっとう**さえ**買いません。(を is replaced)
>ひらがな**さえ**できません。(が is replaced)
>友達に**さえ**合いません。
>友達と**さえ**行きません。

The pattern is used to describe **negative** action (therefore, the clause is in the negative tense), so for positive actions [まで](22) is a better choice. Notice in the examples below that there is the positive tense (not negative).
>難しい漢字さえ読めます。(✕) I can read even difficult kanji.
>難しい漢字**まで**読めます。(OK) I can read even difficult kanji.
