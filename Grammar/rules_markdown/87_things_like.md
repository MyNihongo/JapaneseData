In order to list multiple things and say *"and alike"* a word `など` is used at the end of the list. Commonly items in these lists are connected by the [や particle](180) which implies that these are not the only items.　To the contrary, the [と particle](179) implies that the mentioned items are the only relevant items.
There can be only one item with *など*, so in this case its meaning becomes similar to [みたいな](83).
>歌舞伎**や**生け花**など**が好きです。I like kabuki, ikebana and things like that.
>本**など**がありません。I don't have things like books.
