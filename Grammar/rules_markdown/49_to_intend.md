In order to say that one plans or intends to do something `verb + つもり` pis used. If a positive action is planned then a dictionary form is followed by *つもり*, however, is a negative action is planned then a verb in the negative present tense is followed by *つもり*.

|Tense|Usage|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Positive|verb (dic.) + つもり|食べる**つもり**です|
|Negative|verb (ない-form) + つもり|食べない**つもり**です|
|Negative|verb (dic.) + つもりはない|食べる**つもりはない**です|

Please note that it can be used only **for yourself** and not for other persons.
>日本に行く**つもり**です。I plan to go to Japan.
>日本に行かない**つもり**です。I plan not to go to Japan.

In order to say about intentions of other persons use `つもりだそうです` which is a combination of *つもり* and [そうです](106) (which can be translated as *"I heard that"*).
>あさみさんは日本に行く**つもりだそう**です。Asami intends to go to Japan.

In order to say that the speaker does not have any intention of doing something then *つもり* itself is conjugated into the negative form while the verb before it is in the positive form. It is also possible to negate the verb itself, but the first way is a stronger statement.
>それを教えてあげる**つもりはない**です。I have no intentions of telling you.
>それを教えてあげ**ない**つもりです。I don't plan to tell you.

There are several way how to express intentions and here are the differences:
- [verbおう + と思ってる](146) - *つもり* is more certain. Even though *"verbおう + と思ってる"* shows that the speaker has been thinking about it *つもり* implies more determination
- [予定](140) - *予定* is a defined plan (e.g. plans for tomorrow or schedule), but even though *つもり* expresses some certainty it is not 100% certain
