When a verb is modified with `かけ` it implies the meaning that the action is not finished. Since かけ is a noun it can be connected with other nouns by the [の particle](178).
In order to create this form add かけ to the verb stem. Examples are shown in the table below.

|Form|Usage|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Verb|V (~~ます~~) + かけ|食べ**かけ**|
|Verb|V (~~ます~~) + かけ**の** + N|食べ**かけ**のすし|

>すしは食べ**かけ**です。Sushi are not eat yet.
>食べ**かけ**のすしです。Sushi which are not eaten yet.

Looking at the examples above it is worth mentioning that has already started eating sushi, but not finished yet. For example there is a set of 8 sushi, but now there are 6 sushi. In this case かけ can be used.
To the contrary, if the sushi set is still not open it is better to use [まだ][21] instead of かけ.
>すしを**まだ**食べていません。I have not eaten the sushi yet.
