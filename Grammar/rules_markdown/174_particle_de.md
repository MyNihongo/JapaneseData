When there is an action which is performed (to do something) the `で` particle is used to indicate a location. On the contrary [に](175) is used with other verbs (e.g. ある, いる, 住んでいる) and with these verbs `で` usually cannot be used, but there is an exception for *"ある"*.

>レストラン**で**エベントが**ある**。There is an event in the restaurant.

When a subject can be classified as an action (e.g. event, accident, etc.) it is all right to use the `で` particle with *ある*.

#### Method
>箸**で**ご飯を食べます。I eat with chopsticks.
