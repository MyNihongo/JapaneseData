In order to emphasise the preceding noun a word `こそ` should be added to the noun. In case a noun already has a particle (e.g. 日本に) the word こそ is added after the particle as it is shown in the table below.
It is also worth mentioning that こそ is used only for positive things, so if the speaker has the negative attitude towards the noun こそ cannot be used.

|Usage|Example|
|-|-|
|Noun + こそ|日本**こそ**|
|Noun + particle + こそ|日本に**こそ**|

The word こそ by itself can be translated as *"absolutely"* or *"for sure"*, therefore, by using this word the speaker implies the determination regarding this object.

>今年**こそ**日本に行きます。This year for sure I will go to Japan.
>今年日本に**こそ**行きます。This year I will go to Japan for sure.

Let us take a look at the previous sentences. The main part is the same, but the only difference is the placement of こそ. How does it make these sentences different?
In the first sentence こそ is placed after 今年, so it means that the speaker emphasises the period when he or she wants to go to Japan. In other words it is only this year and nothing else, but the country may change.
In the second sentence こそ is placed after 日本に (notice that it is after the に particle, not before), so it means that the speaker emphasises the country he or she wants to go to. In other words it is only Japan and nothing else, but the period may change.
