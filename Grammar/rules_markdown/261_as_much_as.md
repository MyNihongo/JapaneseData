Previously we learned that [だけ](3) means *"only"*, but `A + だけ + B` can be translated as *"B as much as A"*.
In terms of verbs the frequently used verb forms are [～たい](41) and the [potential form](97) which are translated *"as much as I want"* and *"as much as I can"* respectively.
As for adjectives they are not used that often, but it is possible to come up with some examples.
