The word `際 (さい)` has exactly the same meaning as [とき](183) and is translated as *"when"*, but the difference is that 際 is quite formal and is used mainly in formal writing (e.g. informative announcements, business emails, etc.). Therefore, in conversations with the family and friends it is not usually used, but an exception may be only a joke.
