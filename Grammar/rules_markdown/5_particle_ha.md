The only usage of the `は` particle is being a topic maker, so it introduce a topic to talk about. An approximate English translation could be *as for*. When the *は particle* is used with other particles (e.g. *で*, *に*) it is placed second.

Usage of `は` and [が](171) is often confused, so the first tip would be to remember that *は* introduces a broader scope than *が*. In other words, *は* introduces a complete topic which relates to a grammatical structure before it, while *が* introduces actions or attributes of a grammatical structure before it.

#### This is
>これ**は**東京です。This is Tokyo. (lit. As for this, it is Tokyo)

It would be ungrammatical to say *"これが東京です"* since *東京 (Tokyo)* is not an action or adjective. So `これ` introduces a new topic (東京) in the sentence. It is also quite difficult to say what it would mean in English (something like *"It Tokyo"*).

#### Someone does
>日本人**は**行きます。A Japanese person goes. (lit. As for a Japanese person, he / she goes)

Contrary to the previous example, the *が* particle would also be fine (see [が particle](171)), but `は` makes the sentence more neutral.

#### Two particles
>東京**には**日本人がいます。There are Japanese people in Tokyo. (lit. As for what there is in Tokyo, there are Japanese people)

First of all `が` is not used in combination with other particles, therefore, `が` cannot be used after *東京*, so it is definitely `は`. Secondly, a clause *"日本人がいます"* is not performed by Tokyo, but rather it is related to Tokyo, therefore, *"東京に"* is an introduction of what there is in Tokyo.

The difference might be subtle at first, but with practice it will become all right. Let us cover some usages of the [が particle](171) next.
