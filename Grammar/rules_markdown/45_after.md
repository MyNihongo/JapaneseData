In Japanese there are two forms of how to say that one does something after something has been done.

|Usage|Example|
|-|-|
|verbて + から|食べ**てから**|
|verbた + 後で|食べ**た後で**|
|noun + の後で|勉強**の後で**|

#### てから
The form `てから` is constructed from the [て-form](52) of a verb which is followed by *から* which means *after*. This form puts more emphasis on the fact that the first action must be finished before the second one can be started, i.e. when the order of actions is important.
Another point of *てから* is doing one action right after another.
>仕事を終わっ**てから**パーティーにいく。I must finish my work, then I will go to a party.
>宿題し**てから**出かけました。I went outside right after finishing my homework.
#### た後で
The form `た後で` is constructed from a verb in the casual context in the past affirmative tense which is followed by *後で* which also means after. If a noun is used with *後で* the noun must be connected by the *の particle*.
This form simply states the fact than one action is performed after another, so there is no obligation to finish the first action before the second one, i.e. when the order of actions is not so important. *後で* does not specify how much time elapsed between to actions.
>日本語の勉強し**た後で**寝ます。After I study Japanese I go to sleep.
>日本語の勉強**の後で**寝ます。After I study Japanese I go to sleep.
