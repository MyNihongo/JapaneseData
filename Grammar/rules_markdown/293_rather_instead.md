The expression `むしろ` is used to express the fact that the speaker would do something in a different way. It comes from the word [むしろ](w1604870) which is translated as *"rather"* or *"better"*.  
むしろ is usually used when the speaker wants to express disagreement with the previous statement and say that he or she would do something else instead.
