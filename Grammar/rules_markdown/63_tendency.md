#### Describing a personality
In order to describe a personality (yourself or other people) a form `がり` is used. The *がり-form* is a derivative from a [がる-form](64), so only the final *る* is replaced with *り*, therefore, only い-adjectives or forms which conjugate like い-adjectives ([たい-form](41), negative adjectives) can have the *がり-form*.
A word with *がり* is considered to be a noun, therefore, all grammatical rules for nouns apply for the *がり-form* as well. However, when a noun with modified with *がり* there is **no particle** which connects *がり* and the noun.
When Japanese people describe someone they may add a `屋 (や)` or `屋さん (やさん)` (more friendly) word right after *がり*.
>恥ずかし**がり**だから、あまり友達がいません。Because he is a shy person he has hardly any friend.
>目立ちた**がり**屋です。A person who likes to stand out.
#### Being sensitive
Another meaning of the *がり-form* is describing that someone is sensitive to something, e.g. to cold, heat, brightness, etc.
>寒**がり**だから、あまり冬が好きじゃないです。Because I am sensitive to cold I don't really like winter. (Saying that someone is tends to be cold does not really make sense because 寒い describes the weather)
