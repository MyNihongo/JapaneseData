In order to say that the speaker is now able to do something a pattern `verb + ようになる` is used usually in the past tense so `ようになった`. The pattern indicates that the speaker was not able to do something, but now the speaker can do it (the verb *なる* emphasises this change). The grammar structure is created my attaching *ようになる* to the casual for of a verb in the **potential** form (the [potential form](97) indicates the ability to do something).

|Pattern|Example|
|-|-|
|potential casual form + ようになる|食べられる**ようになる**|

>日本人を聞き取れる**ようになった**。I'm finally able to understand what Japanese say.

Another common usage of the *ようになる* pattern is saying that the speaker wants to be able to do something, e.g. *"I want to be able to speak Japanese"*. In this case the verb *なる* is conjugated into the [たい-form](41) which indicates that the first person (i.e. the speaker) wants to do something. *Note* that a verb before *ようになりたい* is still in the **potential** form.

>日本語で新聞を読める**ようになりたい**です。I want to be able to read newspaper in Japanese.
