The pattern `A + さえ～ば + B` is translated as *"as long as"* and it means as long as the A clause is true then the B clause is also true. The pattern is created by using the [ば form](55). The usage of the pattern are shown in the table below.

|Form|Usage|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Verb|V (~~ます~~) + されすれば|食べさえすれば|
|Verb|V (~~ます~~) + さえしなければ|食べさえしなければ|
|Noun|N + さえあれば|勉強さえあれば|
|Noun|N + さえなければ|勉強さえなければ|

When the pattern is used with verbs the main verb does not change its tense, so whether it is positive or negative is determined by the する verb in the [ば form](55), i.e. すれば is positive and しなければ is negative.
When the pattern is used with nouns the tense is determined by the ある verb in the [ば form](55), i.e. あれば is positive and なければ is negative. When talking about living things the verb いる is used instead.
