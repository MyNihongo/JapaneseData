In order to compare two objects a pattern `Aのほうが + Bより + adjective` is used where `A is more + adjective + than B`. In different circumstances both *のほうが* and *より* may be omitted in a sentence provided that it is clear that is compared and how.
>日本**のほうが**イギリス**より**好きです。I like Japan more than Great Britain.
>思った**より**簡単だ。It is easier than I thought.
>日本**のほうが**いいです。Japan is better.
