The expression `ことはない` is used to imply that there no reason to do something. In the spoken language the は is often omitted so the expression becomes `ことない`.

|Verb|V (dic.) + ことはない|食べる**ことはない**です|

Often it is used to soothe someone by saying *"心配することはない"*, namely *"there is no need to worry"*.

>落ち込む**ことはない**です。There is no need to feel down.  
>落ち込む**ことない**です。There is no need to feel down.

Another similar grammar is [なくてもいい](32) which also means *"you don't have to"*. Most people will say that these two forms are interchangeable, but there is a slight nuance. Let us consider the next sentences where the speaker says it to a person B.
>謝る**ことはない**です。You do not need to apologise.
>謝ら**なくてもいい**です。There is no need to apologise.

The first sentence (ことはない) implies that there is literally nothing to apologise for. For example the person B did something (e.g. coughed) and apologised to the speaker. But actually there is really no need to apologise for it. In these cases ことはない is the best option.
The second sentence (なくてもいい) implies that the person B has done something for which it is better to apologise, but the speaker by saying 謝らなくてもいい states that the person B does not need to worry about it. In other words, なくてもいい is used when there is a valid reason to apologise, but since it is not a big deal it is all right not to apologise.
