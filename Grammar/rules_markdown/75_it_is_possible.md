In order to say that something is technically possible an expression `verb + 事ができる` is used. Similarly in order to say that something is not technically possible the verb **できる** is conjugated into the negative form, i.e. `verb + 事ができない`.
>箸で食べる**事ができる**。I am able to eat with chopsticks.

>車に乗る**事ができない**。I am not able to drive a car.

Another way of saying that someone can do something is by using the [potential form ～える](97), but the main difference is that *verb + 事ができる* imposes a technical ability or inability, while the potential form imposes all other meanings, e.g. someone can technically do something, but due to various circumstances cannot do it at the moment.
>忙しいので、パーティーに行**けない**。I cannot go to the party because I am busy.

>足が壊れてるから、パーティーに行く**事ができない**。I cannot go to the party because my legs are broken.
