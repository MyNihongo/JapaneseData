In order to say that something is technically possible an expression `verb + ことができる` is used. Similarly in order to say that something is not technically possible the verb **できる** is conjugated into the negative form, i.e. `verb + ことができない`.
>箸で食べる**ことができます**。I am able to eat with chopsticks.
>車に乗る**ことができません**。I am not able to drive a car.

Another way of saying that someone can do something is by using the [potential form ～える](97), but the main difference is that *verb + ことができる* imposes a technical ability or inability, while the potential form imposes all other meanings, e.g. someone can technically do something, but due to various circumstances cannot do it at the moment.
In other cases *ことができる* sounds more polite
>忙しいので、パーティーに行**けません**。I cannot go to the party because I am busy.
>足が壊れてるから、パーティーに行く**ことができません**。I cannot go to the party because my legs are broken.
