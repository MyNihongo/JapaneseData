In order to express a desired outcome in the past (*should have + verb* in English) a pattern `verbば + よかった` is used where a verb is in the [conditional form ば](55) is followed by an いい-adjective (translates as *"good"*) in the past tense. A literal translation of the expression in English is *"I which I had done something"*.
