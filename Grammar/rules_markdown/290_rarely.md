The expression `めったに～ない` is used to indicate that something occurs quite rarely or almost never. It is comes from the word [滅多に](w1612000) which is translated as *"seldom"* or *"rarely"*. The verb which is used together with めったに must be in the **negative form**.

There is also a word [あまり](54) which is used to describe infrequent actions, but めったに is used for super-rare actions which almost never occur.
