In order to express the wish or hope the expression `たらいいな` is used. It consists of three parts, i.e. [たら condition](185), いい adjective and [な final particle](191). Even though the expression is translated as *"if A then it is good"*, the な particle adds the meaning of desire and wish of the speaker.
