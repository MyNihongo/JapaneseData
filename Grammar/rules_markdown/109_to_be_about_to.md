In order to say that an action occurs close to present (either in past or future) a form `verb + ところ` is used. The verb must be in its casual form, but can be conjugated into present, past or other tenses, however *ところ* can only be in the present tense.

|Tense|Meaning|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Present|I am about to + V|食べる**ところ**です|
|Past|I just finished + V|食べた**ところ**です|
|Present continuous|now I am just + V|食べている**ところ**です|

>まだ食べていなくて、食べる**ところ**です。I have not eaten yet, I am just about to eat.
>食べた**ところ**だから、今すぐ働きたくないです。I don't want to work right now because I've had a lunch.
>食べている**ところ**ですから、会議に行けません。I cannot go to a meeting because currently I am eating.

たところだ is quite similar to [たばかり](109), however, the difference is that たところだ indicates the real time span, but たばかり indicates the speaker's feeling (reality may differ).
>授業が始まった**ところ**です。Studies have just begun.
>授業が始まった**ばかり**です。Studies have just begun.

The first sentence (たところ) states that it has been like one day since the studies began, so literally the time span is short.
The second sentence (たばかり) states that the speaker feels like the studies have just begun, however, in reality it might be a month or year since the beginning.
