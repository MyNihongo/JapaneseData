In order to say that an action occurs close to present (either in past or future) a form `verb + ところ` is used. The verb must be in its casual form, but can be conjugated into present, past or other tenses, however *ところ* can only be in the present tense.

|Tense|Meaning|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Present|I was about to + verb|食べる**ところ**(です)|
|Past|I just finished + verb|食べた**ところ**(です)|
|Present continuous|now I am just + verb|食べている**ところ**(です)|

When a verb is in the past the meaning of the *ところ-form* becomes the same as the meaning of [たばかり](108).
>まだ食べていなくて、食べる**ところ**です。I have not eaten yet, I am just about to eat.
>食べた**ところ**だから、今すぐ働きたくないです。I don't want to work right now because I've had a lunch.
>食べている**ところ**ですから、会議に行けません。I cannot go to a meeting because currently I am eating.
