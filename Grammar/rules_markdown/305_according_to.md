The expression `A + によると + B` means *"according to"* and is used to express a the clause B which is based on the clause A. It comes from the verb [依る (よる)](w1168660) which is translated as *"due to"* or *"to be based on"* and the [と conditional](90) which implies that the clause B is always true whenever the clause A is true. Not often, but the [ば form](55) can also be used instead the と conditional so the form will be `A + によれば + B`.  
Since the grammar implies that the speaker references to another source of information quite often [そうだ](110) grammar which means *"I heard that"* is used.
