### Formal (てはいけない)
In order to formally say that something must not be done a `てはいけない` is used. The grammar structure is created of a verb in the [て-form](52) and a verb *いく* in the negative potential conjugation, so an approximate translation of the grammar point could be: "if one does something it can't go like this".
>電話を使っ**てはいけません**。You must not use a phone.
>電話を使っ**てはいけない**です。You must not use a phone.

The two sentences above have the same level of politeness, however, the *いけません* is better for writing while *けないです* is better for speaking.

### Casual (ちゃいけない / じゃいけない)
In a less formal situation this form may be converted into `ちゃいけない` or `じゃいけない`, as well as `ちゃダメ` or `じゃダメ`. This form is also based on the *て-form* of the verb, but the final *て* or *で* is dropped. Distinction between *～ちゃ* and *～じゃ* is determined by the alternation of the *て-form*. The rule is the following:
- `ちゃ` if て-form ends with て
- `じゃ` if て-form ends with で

It is quite easy to remember because *ちゃ* has no alternation like *て*, but *じゃ* has the alternation like *で*. Even though the latter is form is semantically the same its translation might be interpreted as: "if one does something it is bad". Since `ダメ` is a noun it must be followed by *だ* (informal).
>使う -> 使って (ends with て) -> 使っちゃ
>電話を使っ**ちゃいけません**。You cannot use a phone.
>電話を使っ**ちゃダメ**です。

>飲む -> 飲んで (ends with で) -> 飲んじゃ
>お酒を飲ん**じゃいけません**。You cannot drink alcohol.
>お酒を飲ん**じゃダメ**です。
