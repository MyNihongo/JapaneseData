If a noun is a final object of a sentence `です` (in the formal context) and `だ` (casual context) indicate that something is. Actually the usage of *です* is much more ample, but for the time being it is more than enough. The form conjugates based on the tense (present or past) or form (affirmative or negative).

|Tense|Form|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Present affirmative|～です|日本人**です**|
|Present negative|～じゃないです|日本人**じゃないです**|
|Past affirmative|～でした|日本人**でした**|
|Past negative|～じゃなかったです|日本人**じゃなかったです**|

### Present affirmative form
Let's take a look at the sentence *"I am Japanese"*.
>日本人**です**。I am Japanese.
>日本人**である**。The Japanese.
>日本人**だ**。The Japanese.

*です* is the polite form which is used both in speaking in writing. *である* is a casual form which is used in writing (e.g. reports). *だ* is also a casual form which is used in speaking.

It may be noted that in the previous sentences a subject of the sentence is omitted (e.g. `日本人です` instead of `私は日本人です`). In a natural Japanese sentence a subject of the sentence is always omitted whenever it is unambiguously clear what or who the subject is. It is important to note and get used to from the very beginning, so the sentence `私は日本人です` is grammatically correct, but does not sound natural at all.

### Present negative form
Let's take a look at the sentence *"I am not Japanese"*.
>日本人**じゃないです**。
>日本人**ではありません**。
>日本人**じゃない**。
>日本人**ではない**。

*じゃないです* is the polite form which is used in speaking. *ではありません* is the polite form which is used in writing. *じゃない* is the casual form which is used in speaking. *ではない* is the casual form which is used in writing.
Remember that `じゃ` is used for speaking. It is replaced by `では` in writing.

### Past affirmative form
Let's take a look at the sentence *"I was Japanese"*.
>日本人**でした**。It was the Japanese.
>日本人**だった**。It was the Japanese.

*でした* is the polite form which is used both in writing and speaking. *だった* is the casual form which is used both in writing and speaking.

### Past negative form
Let's take a look at the sentence *"I was not Japanese"*.
>日本人**じゃなかったです**。
>日本人**ではありませんでした**。
>日本人**じゃなかった**。
>日本人**ではなかった**。

Difference is the same as it was for the past tense.
*じゃなかったです* is the polite form which is used in speaking. *ではありませんでした* is the polite form which is used in writing. *じゃなかった* is the casual form which is used in speaking. *ではなかった* is the casual form which is used in writing.
Remember that `じゃ` is used for speaking. It is replaced by `では` in writing.
