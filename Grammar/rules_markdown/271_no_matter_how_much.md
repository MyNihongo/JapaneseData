The expression `いくら + A + ても、+ B` is used to express that the clause B is still true despite the clause A and is translated as *"no matter how much"* or *"no matter how many times"*. The clause B can have either the positive feeling or negative. The first clause consists of a word [いくら](w1219980) and the [ても form](127).
In case of the negative feeling it becomes similar to [のに](94) which expresses the regret of the speaker and inability to complete the clause B.

>**いくら**日本語を勉強し**ても**、日本人と話せません。No matter how much I study I cannot talk to Japanese people.
>**いくら**落とし**ても**、割れません。No matter how much I drop it it does not break.

As it was mentioned previously both positive and negative emotions can be expressed by "いくら～ても". The first sentence expresses the speaker's regret that he or she still cannot talk to Japanese people despite all the effort. On the other hand the second sentence expresses the fact that something does not break despite how many times it is dropped.

### いくら vs どんなに vs たとえ
いくら and [どんなに](263) have practically the same meaning and they are easily interchangeable, but there is a slight nuance. いくら simply states that the speaker has tried doing it several times, but どんなに expresses that the speaker have tried hard doing something ([頑張る](w1217700)). For いくら it is not specified whether or now the speaker has tried hard.
