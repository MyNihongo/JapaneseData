The word `うちに` may have two different meanings depending on what is used before the expression - *"while"* and *"before"*.
Basically if the verb in the negative form (ない) is before うちに then the meaning is *"before"* and for all other cases the meaning is *"while"*.
- Verb (ない): before;
- Anything else: while.

## While (change at the moment)
|Form|Usage|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Verb|V (dic) + うちに|食べる**うちに**|
|Verb|V (ている) + うちに|食べている**うちに**|
|い-adjective|A + うちに|新しい**うちに**|
|な-adjective|A + **な**うちに|きれい**なうちに**|
|Noun|N + **の**うちに|日本人の**うちに**|

For all adjectives the negative tenses can still be used without changing the meaning of うちに to "before". When the verbs are used the meaning becomes somewhat similar to [間に](53), but the second clause of うちに is more flexible.

>日本にいる**うちに**、東京に行きたいです。While I am in Japan I want to go to Tokyo.
>日本語を勉強している**うちに**、日本語で話します。While I am studying Japanese I talk in Japanese.
>新しい**うちに**、車を使います。While it is new I use the car.
>きれい**なうちに**、掃除しません。While it is clean I do not clean it.
>学生**のうちに**、働きません。While I am a student I do not work.

## Before (change in the future)
|Form|Usage|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Verb|V (ない) + **うちに**|食べない**うちに**|

As soon as the verb in the negative form is used before うちに the meaning slightly changes to *"before"* or *"until"* which means that the action which the verb describes will be true some time in the future.

>食べない**うちに**、料理の写真を撮ります。Before I eat I take a picture of the food.
>忘れない**うちに**、メモします。Before I forget it I make a note.
