One of the ways how to ask for the confirmation from the listener is by using a pattern `verbた + らいいか` when the first clause is just a statement (i.e. not a question). This pattern literally means *"is it good if I do"* which is used for asking for advice.
This pattern is created from the [たら if-form](90) which is followed by *いいか*.

|Form|Example|
|-|-|
|casual past + らいいか|食べ**たらいいか**|

>先生に聞い**たらいいですか**。Should I ask the teacher?

However, when the first clause a question the meaning of the pattern changes to seeking instructions from the listener, e.g. what to do in order to do something.
>これから**何を**食べ**たらいいですか**。What should I eat from now on?
