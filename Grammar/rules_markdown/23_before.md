In order to say a word *before* in Japanese `前` + `に` or `で` is used. *で* refers to actions which are performed in from of something, while *に* refers to anything else. Its meaning refers to something before an event (A happens before B), time reference or location (in front of).
*Grammar note*. If *前* is used after a noun a `の particle` connects the noun and *前*, however, with the time reference the *の particle* is not used. A dictionary form of verbs is used before *前*.
