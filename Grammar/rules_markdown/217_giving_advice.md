One of several ways of how to give advice is Japanese is the expression `ばいいよ` which can be broken down into three components. The first one is the [ば condition](186) then it is the いい adjective and the final one is the [よ final particle](189). So the expression can be translated as *"if A then it is good"*.

|Form|Usage|Example|

|Verb|V (ば) + いいよ|食べれ**ばいいよ**|

|な-adjective|A + ならいいよ|きれい**ならいいよ**|

This expression has exactly the same meaning as [たらいいよ](216), but the difference is that ばいいよ is more often used in the formal context or writing while たらいいよ is used in speaking.
