In order to say that another persons shows signs of something a form `がる` is used. The form is constructed by replacing the final *い* with *がる*. This form can only modify *い-adjectives* or other grammatical structures which conjugate like *い-adjectives*, e.g. expressing desires for verbs with a [たい-form](41).
The *がる-form* (1 group) and conjugates accordingly.
>怖**がります**。He looks afraid.

#### Describing desires of other persons
The [たい-form](41) or [が欲しい-form](11) are used to describe a desire of the speaker and they do not allow describing a desire of other persons. However, due to the fact that both the *たい-form* and the *が欲しい-form* conjugate like い-adjectives*, the *がる-form* is used to describe wishes of other persons.
>あさみさんは日本に行きた**がり**ます。Asami wants to go to Japan.
>あさみさんは新しいパソコンが欲し**がり**ます。Asami wants a new computer.

When the present tense is used it describes the desire of the speaker at the current moment. In order to express that the speaker always wants something the verb がる must be in the [ている continuous state](44).
>あさみさんはなっとうを食べた**がり**ます。Asami now wants to eat natto.
>あさみさんはなっとうを食べた**がって**います。Asami always wants to eat natto.
