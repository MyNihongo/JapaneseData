To the contrary of [は](5) the `が` particle is a *subject* (not a topic) maker which means it introduces an action or an attribute which relates to the subject.

#### Adjectives
Adjectives are usually used with the `が` particle.
In the first example the adjective *きれいです* is related to *女の人*.
In the second example the adjective *長いです* is related to *髪* (**not *女の人***), therefore, the `は` particle is used to introduce a topic to whom the next clause is related. Practically `Aは + Bが + adjective` is a pattern for *"A has + adjective + B"*.

>女の人**が**きれいです。A woman is beautiful.
>女の人は髪**が**長いです。A woman has a long hair. (lit. As for a girl, there is a long hair.)

#### いる／ある／わかる
Verbs `ある`, `いる` (to be, to have) and `わかる` (to understand) are always used with the `が` (or [も](172)) particle.

>本**が**あります。I have a book.
>猫**が**います。I have a cat.
>日本語**が**わかります。I understand Japanese.

#### Subject's action (emphasis)
In this example the `が` particle introduces a subject which is also a topic (so *は* would also be fine here), but the `が` particle adds more emotions to the sentence and puts an emphasis on the subject.

>女の人は東京に行きました。Did Ayako go to Tokyo?
>いや、私**が**（行きました）。No, it was me!

#### But
There is a similar usage with [でも](6), but *でも* contrasts two separate sentences, not two parts of the same sentence.

>日本に来ました**が**、日本語がわかりません。I came to Japan, but don't understand Japanese.
