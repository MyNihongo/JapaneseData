In order to say that someone wants an object a grammar structure `XはYが欲しい` is used where Y is someone and X is the object. The adjective *欲しい* may also be spelled in hiragana, i.e. *ほしい*. This structure cannot be used with verbs (for verbs the required structure is [Verb + たい](41)), therefore, saying *食べる欲しい* is ungrammatical. Even though *食べるのが欲しい* (note a particle の after the verb) is grammatically correct such a structure is never used in Japanese.

>新しい車が**欲しいです**。I want a new car. (Formal context)
>新しい車が**欲しい**。I want a new car. (Casual context)
