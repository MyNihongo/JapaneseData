The expression `べきだ` is translated as *"should do"* and introduces a very strong advice for someone else, so べきだ cannot be used for the speaker's actions (it would sound like the speaker gives advice to himself or herself which would sound a bit weird). To the contrary, [なければいけない](31) is more casual and may be used both in speaking and writing while べきだ is meant only for writing (therefore, there is the special usage with な- and い-adjectives).
べきだ can also be conjugated to the past tense (i.e. `べきだった`) and the meaning would be *"should have done"*.
This is the counterpart of [べきではない](257) which means *"should not do"*.

|Form|Usage|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Verb|V (dic.) + べきだ|食べる**べき**です|
|Verb|するV (~~る~~) + べきだ|勉強す**べき**です|
|い-adjective|イA (~~い~~) + **くある**べきだ|新しくある**べき**です|
|な-adjective|ナA + **である**べきだ|きれいである**べき**です|

Even though する verbs have a special usage it is also fine to use the dictionary from with べきだ. Both options are valid.
>勉強すべきだ (OK)
>勉強するべきだ (OK)

>知らない漢字を調べる**べき**です。You should look up the unknown kanji.
>日本語を勉強す**べき**です。You should study Japanese.
>パソコンを買うとき、新し**くあるべき**です。When you buy a PC it should be new.
>引っ越したい区は、静か**であるべき**です。District where you want to move should be quiet.

Below is an example with べきだった (past tense). In contrast to [ばよかった](155) it does not express any regrets from the speaker, but just states the fact.
>幼稚園のとき、漢字の読み方を勉強する**べきでした**。In the kindergarten you should have studied readings of kanji.
