The pattern `も～ば、～も` is used to introduce two clauses each of which has either the positive feeling or the negative feeling. It is not allowed to mix them, e.g. if the first clause is positive and the second is negative this sentence is ungrammatical for this pattern.

|Form|Usage|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Verb|N も V (ば), N も|海**も**あれ**ば**、山**も**ある|
|い-adjective|N も イA (~~い~~) **けれ**ば, N も|パソコン**も**新しけれ**ば**、モニター**も**広い|
|な-adjective|N も ナA なら, N も|部屋**も**きれい**なら**、近所**も**静かだ|
|Noun|N も N なら, N も|友達**も**日本人**なら**、両親**も**優しい|

>日本語は漢字**も**難しけれ**ば**、文法**も**覚えません。In Japanese the kanji are difficult and I cannot memorise the grammar.
>日本語**も**勉強しやすけれ**ば**、アニメ**も**面白いです。Japanese is easy to study and anime are also interesting.

Note that in both sentences all clauses have the same feeling. The first sentence implies the negative feeling about studying Japanese (both kanji and grammar are difficult) and the second sentence implies the positive feeling (easy to study and it is fun watching anime).
As it was said in the beginning mixing the feelings is not allowed in this grammar. Therefore, the sentence above is not grammatically correct.
>日本語は漢字**も**難しけれ**ば**、アニメ**も**面白いです。(✕) In Japanese the kanji are difficult and anime are also interesting.

Since the first clause has the negative feeling and the second clause has the positive feeling the meaning of the whole sentence becomes weird.
