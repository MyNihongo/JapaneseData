In order to say that someone does something in advance (i.e. in preparation for the future) a pattern `verbて + おく` is used. The pattern consists of a verb in its [て-form](52) and a verb *置く* written in hiragana which means *"to put"*.
>日本に行く前にちゃんと日本語を勉強し**ておきます**。Before going to Japan I will study Japanese. (I do it in preparation for the trip)

There is also a more casual way to express the same idea which is [～とく](232).
>日本に行く前にちゃんと日本語を勉強し**ときます**。Before going to Japan I will study Japanese.
