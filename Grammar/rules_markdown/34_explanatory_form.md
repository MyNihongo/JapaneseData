The explanatory `んです-form` has quite some usage cases, but in this article we would cover where *んです* is used with explanations.
**Note**: *んです* is only used in the spoken language. In the writing use [からです or から](18) and [ので](18).

- Polite form: `のです` is used in writing
- Casual form: `んです` is used in speaking, but if persons are good friends `んです` may be used in emails and chats.

There are four cases where *んです* is used as a means of explaining (examples will follow shortly):
- Guess the assumption (e.g. tell me whether I am right or not)
- Asking for information (e.g. tell me, I want to know it)
- Asking for a reason (e.g. tell me, I want to know why)
- Explaining the reason (e.g. I will tell you why)

Before jumping to examples let us take a look at how to create the *んです* form. The pattern is `casual form + んです` where verbs, nouns and adjectives can be either in the past or in the present tense. The table below only shows the present tense, but the pattern for the past tense is the same.

|Form|Positive|Negative|
|-|-|-|
|verb|食べる**ん**です or 食べる**の**です|食べない**ん**です or 食べない**の**です|
|noun|日本人**なん**です or 日本人**なの**です|日本人じゃない**ん**です or 日本人じゃない**の**です|
|い-adjective|忙しい**ん**です or 忙しい**の**です|忙しくない**ん**です or 忙しくない**の**です|
|な-adjective|きれい**なん**です or きれい**なの**です|きれいじゃない**ん**です or きれいじゃない**の**です|

### Guess the assumption
In the example below a person A notices that a person B speaks English very good, but does not know whether or not the person B is from the UK or not. Therefore, the person A wants to know the reason and tries to confirm the assumption about the person B's origin.
>A: ジョンさん、英語が上手ですね。イギリスに住んでいた**んですか**。John, your English is very good. Are you from the UK?
>B: はい、去年イギリスから日本に来ました。Yes, last year I came to Japan from the UK.

### Asking for information
In this example a person A likes a game, but the person A does not know where it was bought. Therefore, the person A wants to know it (in order to buy it as well) and asks for this information.

>A: とても面白いゲームですね。どこで買った**んですか**。This game is very interesting. Where did you buy it?
>B: 秋葉原で買いました。In Akihabara.

### Asking for a reason and explaining
In this example a person A does not know the reason why a person B was late and asks for explanation. The person B explains the reason to the person A.
**Note**: in previous examples a person B responds without *んです* because the person B does not need to explain a reason (confirm or deny an assumption; provide new information), but in this example there is a question word `どうして` which implies that the person B needs to provide a reason. Therefore, the person B explains the situation and uses *んです*.

>A: どうして遅刻した**んですか**。Why were you late?
>B: 渋滞な**んです**。Because of the traffic.
