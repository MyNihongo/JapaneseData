In order to say that something is necessary an expression `noun + 必要です` is used. A particle with connects a noun and *必要* may be either *は* or *が*. In most cases the *が particle* is used, but when the speaker wants to emphasise that a noun which is necessary is the only necessity the *は particle* is used.
In order to use the expression with verbs the *～ing form* of the verb must be created with either `の` or `事`.
>綾子ちゃん**は必要だ**。I need Ayako.

>新しいパソコン**が必要です**。I need a new computer.

>毎日運動する事**が必要です**。I need to do physical exercises every day.
***
Another way how the word *必要* can be used **only with verbs** is by using a verb *ある*, so the final expression is `verb + 必要がある` which literally means that there is a necessity to do something. The verb *ある* can be conjugated into a negative or affirmative tense to indicate whether a necessity is or not.
>明日早く起きる**必要がある**。Tomorrow I need to wake up early.

>夏だからもう宿題をする**必要がない**。It is not necessary to do a homework any more because it's summer.
