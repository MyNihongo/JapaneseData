The expression `A てはじめて B` means that the clause B is true only after A is completed and the expression can be translated as *"only after"*. It consists of a verb on the [て form](52) and the word はじめて which is translated *"for the first time"*.

|Form|Usage|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Verb|V (て) + はじめて|食べて**はじめて**|

>なっとうを食べて**はじめて**、おいしさがわかりました。Only after I ate natto, I understood its deliciousness.
>日本語を勉強し始めて**はじめて**、漢字を見ました。Only after I started learning Japanese I saw kanji.

In all these example sentences indicate that the second clause (after はじめて) was not true. For example in the first example the speaker did not know how tasty natto was until he or she tasted it for the first time.
