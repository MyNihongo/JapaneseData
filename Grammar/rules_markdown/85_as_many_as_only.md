#### As many as
In order to emphasise that a count of something is a lot to the speaker (i.e. as many as) a [counter](159) is modified with a `も` particle.
>あさみさんは犬が五匹**も**います。Asami has as many as five dogs.
#### As few as (want more)
In order to emphasise that a count of something is small to the speaker (i.e. as few as) a counter is modified with a `しか` particle and it expresses the idea that the speaker **wants more**. Therefore, if it is not the case (i.e. the speaker just states that there are few items, but does not want more items) [だけ](3) should be used instead to simply state the fact.
An important grammatical note is that the しか turns the whole clause into the negative tense, but semantically the tense is still positive.
>あさみさんは犬が五匹**しか**い**ません**。Asami has as few as five dogs.
