#### As many as
In order to emphasise that a count of something is a lot to the speaker (i.e. as many as) a [counter](159) is modified with a `も` particle.
>綾子ちゃんは犬が五匹**も**います。Ayako has as many as five dogs.
#### As few as
In order to emphasise that a count of something is small to the speaker (i.e. as few as) a counter is modified with a `しか` particle. An important grammatical note is that the *しか particle* turns the whole clause into the negative tense, but semantically the tense is still positive.
>綾子ちゃんは犬が五匹**しか**い**ません**。Ayako has as few as five dogs.
