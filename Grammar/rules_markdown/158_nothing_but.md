In order to express a negative opinion about the fact that it never changes (e.g. *"nothing but crying"*) a pattern `ばかりで` is used. As the word [ばかり](57) it means *"only", "nothing else"* and with the *で* particle the speaker adds his or her negative attitude towards the fact that it never changes.
