Previously we have learnt that [まで](22) expresses the final destination of time or place. まで can also express the surprise of the speaker when something is done beyond the expectations of the speaker.
まで can only be added to nouns, so when it is necessary to use a noun with particles (に, と, へ, etc.) まで is placed after the particle as it shown in the table below.
