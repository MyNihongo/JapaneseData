The expression `～ほかない` means that there is no other choice and the only option is doing what the verb before ～ほかない describes. The verb can only be used in the dictionary form.

|Form|Usage|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Verb|V (dic.) + ほかない|食べる**ほかない**|

The meaning of ほかない is exactly the same of [しかない](221), but the difference is that ほかない is more literal and usually used in writing while しかない is meant for speaking. And as it is shown in the table above ほかない cannot be used with verbs in the negative tense.
