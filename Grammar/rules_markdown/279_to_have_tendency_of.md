The expression `気味だ (ぎみだ)` is used to either describe that *"someone has tendency to"* or that *"something is slightly + state"*.

|Form|Usage|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Verb|V (~~ます~~) + 気味だ|食べ**気味**です|
|Noun|N + 気味だ|勉強**気味**です|

>あの人は毎日日本語を勉強しているので、疲れ**気味**です。That person looks tired because he is studying Japanese every day.  
>試験の時は、あの人は緊張**気味**です。During exams that person tends to be nervous.

In the first example 疲れ気味だ indicated that the person *"looked slightly tired"*. If we compare it to 疲れている which means *"tired"* then 気味だ is weakens the meaning.  

気味 works like a noun, so if another noun must be added to it the [の particle](178) must be use for it.
>彼は寝不足気味**の**人です。He is a person who tends to be deprived of sleep.
