In order to say that something has not yet been done (verbs) or something is still in progress (nouns or adjectives) a word `まだ` is used.
>**まだ**宿題をやっていません。I haven't done my homework yet.
>**まだ**寒いです。It's still cold.
>**まだ**子供です。Someone is still a child.

Note that when *まだ* is used with a verb, the verb must be in the negative [continuous tense](44). It is a set expression, so in case a verb is not in the continuous tense it is ungrammatical.
>授業はまだ終わっていません。The class has not finished yet.
>授業はまだ終わりません。(✕) Ungrammatical
