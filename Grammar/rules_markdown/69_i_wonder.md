In order to express that the speaker is wondering about something there are two sentence-ending constructions which are similar to the *か sentence-ending particle* and these are `かな` (used by anyone) and `かしら` (mainly used by female). Similarly as in English an expression *I was wandering maybe...* emphasises that the speaker ponders over something in hope that it will come true.
>明日一緒にお茶でもします**かな**。I was wondering maybe tomorrow we will drin some tea or something?
>日本に能力試験に受かった**かしら**。I wonder if I have passed the exam.
