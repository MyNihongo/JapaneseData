One of the ways how to say "only" or "just" is by using `だけ`. There are also [しか](85) or [ばかり](57) expressions with slightly more different semantics, but the *だけ-expression* is the most easiest one. Usage of *だけ* does not imply any specific nuance (neutral meaning), but simply states a fact that there is only something. It will be different in the *しか* or *ばかり* forms.
Most common use cases of where *だけ* is used are these sentences:
>国がたくさんあるけど、好きなのは日本だけだ。(There are many countries, but I like only Japan.)
>日本語だけで話しましょうか。(Let us speak only in Japanese.)
>それだけで嬉しくなった。(Just by this I have become happy.)

Another usage of the *だけ-form* is to say "as much as possible" in conjunction with a verb `出来る` (I can), so it implies that a speaker wants to maximise or minimise something to a certain extent.
>出来るだけ日本語を話すの上手になりたいです。(I want to speak Japanese as good as I possibly can)
>出来るだけ新しい漢字を覚えりたいです。(I want to learn new kanji as much as I possible can)
