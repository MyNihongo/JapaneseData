One of the ways how to say "only" or "just" is by using `だけ`. If *だけ* finishes the sentence *です* (or its counterpart) must follow.

|Form|Usage|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Verb|Dictionary form + だけ|食べる**だけ**|
|い-adjective|A + だけ|新しい**だけ**|
|な-adjective|A + **な**だけ|きらいな**だけ**|
|Noun|N + だけ|日本人**だけ**|

There are also [しか](85) or [ばかり](57) expressions with slightly more different semantics, but the *だけ-expression* is the most easiest one. Usage of *だけ* does not imply any specific nuance (neutral meaning), but simply states a fact that there is only something. It will be different in the *しか* or *ばかり* forms.
Most common use cases of where *だけ* is used are these sentences:
>国がたくさんあるけど、好きなのは日本**だけ**です。There are many countries, but I like only Japan.
>日本語**だけ**で話しましょうか。Let us speak only in Japanese.
>それ**だけ**で嬉しくなりました。Just by this I have become happy.

Another usage of the *だけ-form* is to say "as much as possible" in conjunction with a verb `できる` (I can), so it implies that a speaker wants to maximise or minimise something to a certain extent.
>できる**だけ**日本語を話すの上手になりたいです。I want to speak Japanese as good as I possibly can
>できる**だけ**新しい漢字を覚えたいです。I want to learn new kanji as much as I possible can
