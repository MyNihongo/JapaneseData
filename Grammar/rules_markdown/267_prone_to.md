The expression `V (stem) + がち` is used to indicate that someone or something is frequently does the action described by the verb. Furthermore, when がち is applied it often indicates a **negative feeling** towards this action, for example, like [忘れっぽい](226) which describes that the person often forgets something (がち is more formal than っぽい).

>漢字を勉強し**がち**ですから、頭痛がよくあります。Because I am prone to studying kanji I often have the headache.

In this example above the speaker states that he or she often studies kanji and as a result the head often aches. Even though studying kanji is a good action, by using がち the speaker expresses the idea that he or she feels not so good about doing it. Here the reason is indicated in the last clause, i.e. because of the headache.
