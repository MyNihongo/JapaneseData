Humble expressions (謙譲語) are expressions which are used to describe the speaker's (or the *speaker's family's*) actions which are done out of respect to someone else (teacher, boss, customer, etc.), therefore, the humble expressions are never used to describe someone else's actions (see the [honorific expressions](67) to describe actions of someone else).
In the following example the first and second sentences are correct (OK) since they describe an action of the speaker or family, but the third sentence is wrong (✕) since it describes an action of another person.

>**私**はお待ちします。(OK) I wait.  
>**母**はお待ちします。(OK) My mother waits.
>
>**先生**はお待ちします。(✕) Teacher waits.

The common rules are described in this article, but there are [indirect](59) and [direct](193) verbs of humble expressions.

The pattern for making a humble expression is `お + verb stem + します` and it applies to both う- and る-verbs, but it becomes difficult with *する* verbs because the prefix can be either `お` or `ご` and there is no rule for that. So the prefix must be memorised. The `ご` prefix is used more often than the `お` prefix.
||Dictionary form|Humble|
|-|-|-|
|う-verbs|話す|**お**話し**します**|
|る-verbs|食べる|**お**食べ**します**|
|する-verbs (1)|散歩する|**お**散歩**します**|
|する-verbs (2)|電話する|**ご**電話**します**|

`来る` is a special word which is not used in the standard humble pattern due to a reason specified after examples. See [indirect](59) and [direct](193) special verbs.

**Note**: when a verb stem consists only of a single kana (not kanji) character the humble expression cannot be created. For example the verb stem of the verb *見る* is *見 (み)*, therefore, the humble form cannot be created. On the contrary the verb stem of *飲む* is *飲み (のみ)*, therefore, the humble form can be *お飲みします*.
