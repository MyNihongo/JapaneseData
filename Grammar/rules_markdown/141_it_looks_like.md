In order to say that something looks like a pattern `clause + ようです` is used. In these situations the speaker relies on his or her senses (sight, hearing, smell, taste, etc.) and is not completely sure whether or not the clause is true.
It has the same meaning as [みたいだ](82) and [に見える](92), but the difference is that *ようだ* is more formal and is usually used only in writing, therefore, it is not used with a casual ending *だ*. The grammar construction is created differently. Just like with *みたいだ* if *ようです* is used with a verb the meaning of the clause changes to *"it seems"*.
