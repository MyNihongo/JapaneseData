In order to say that someone does something for someone else a pattern `personに + verbて + やる` is used where the person is someone for whom something is done. It has exactly the same meaning as [てあげる](114), bet semantics are different in a way that *てやる* is used when an action is done for inferiors, pets, etc. *てあげる* is used when a person who does an action intends to sound humbly, i.e. the action is done for superiors.
>猫を食わし**てやった**。I fed my cat.

>社長は新しい会社員に仕事を説明し**てやりました**。A president explained work responsibilities to new employees.
