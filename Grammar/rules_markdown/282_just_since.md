The expression `きり` (or `っきり` is also valid) has slightly different meanings depending on whether it is used with verbs or nouns:
- verbs: *"since"* or *"after"*
- nouns: *"just"* or *"only"*

This grammar comes from the word [っきり](w2253310) which has exactly the same meanings as described above. When it is used with nouns in `Aた + きり + B` the clause B is usually in the **negative** tense.
