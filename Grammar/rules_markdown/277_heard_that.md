In order to report that the speaker heard something `らしい` is used. らしい implies that the speaker heard it not from the original source of information, but from someone else who possibly heard it from the origin and reported to the speaker. Therefore, the probability of the clause described with らしい is approximately 80%.

|Form|Usage|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Verb|V (cas.) + らしい|食べる**らしい**です|
|い-adjective|イA + らしい|新しい**らしい**です|
|な-adjective|ナA + らしい|きれい**らしい**です|
|Noun|N + らしい|日本人**らしい**です|

>明日、先生が新しい文法を教える**らしい**です。I heard that tomorrow the teacher will explain a new grammar.
>明日は漢字テスト**らしい**です。I heard that tomorrow will be a kanji test.

A similar grammar for expressing the idea of *"I heard that"* is [そうだ](110), but the difference is that らしい implies that the speaker heard it from someone else who is not the primary source of information, therefore, the probability is around 80%. そうだ implies that the speaker heard it directly from the original source of information, therefore, the probability for そうだ is 100%.

#### "Heard that" vs "Looks like"
**Note** that らしい can also mean [looks like](98). Due to the fact that the form is identical the difference can be spotted only by the context.
>明日は休み**らしい**です。Tomorrow is a day off.
>あさみさんは日本人**らしい**人です。Asami is like a Japanese person.

The first sentence (*"I heard that"*) states that tomorrow is a day off while the second sentence (*"looks like"*) describes Asami's characteristics that she is like a Japanese person. Looking at the translations it is clear that the topics of these two sentences are completely different.
