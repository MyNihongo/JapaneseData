In order to say that you want to do something and if this will can be described with a verb then `verb + たい` is used. This form is created from a verb stem (*ます-form* without *ます*) and *たいです*. The form is used primarily for describing a with of the speaker (e.g. I want to do), so in order to say that someone else wants something a [たがる-form](64) is used or someone else's wish may be used as a direct speech (e.g. someone said that someone wants to).
There are other forms to express the speaker's will, so in order to say that the speaker wants someone else to do something a [て欲しい-form](115) is used. In order to say that the speaker wants an object a [が欲しい-form](11) is used.
The *たい-form* is conjugated as a regular い-adjective as it can be observed in the table below.
