In order to say that you want to do something and if this will can be described with a verb then `verb + たい` is used. This form is created from a verb stem (*ます-form* without *ます*) and *たいです*. The form is used primarily for describing a with of the speaker (e.g. I want to do), so in order to say that someone else wants something a [たがる-form](64) is used or someone else's wish may be used as a direct speech (e.g. someone said that someone wants to).
There are other forms to express the speaker's will, so in order to say that the speaker wants someone else to do something a [て欲しい-form](115) is used. In order to say that the speaker wants an object a [が欲しい-form](11) is used.
The *たい-form* is conjugated as a regular い-adjective as it can be observed in the table below.

|Form|Translation|
|-|-|
|～たいです|want to|
|～たくないです|don't want to|
|～たかったです|wanted to|
|～たくなかったです|didn't want to|

>東京に行き**たい**です。I want to go to Tokyo.
>東京に行き**たくない**です。I don't want to go to Tokyo.

The *たい-form* is quite direct in expressing your wants, so appending [と思います](133) makes the statement not so direct. For example it is often used by teachers when they want to introduce a new task during a class.
>連絡し**たい**と**思います**。I want to address you.

### Another person's want
>(✕)綾子ちゃんは東京に行き**たい**です。Ayako wants to go to Tokyo. (**WRONG!!!**)
>綾子ちゃんは東京に行き**たい**と言っていました。Ayako said that she wanted to go to Tokyo.

Please note *たい* cannot be used to describe another person's want, but it is all right to ask a question with *たい*. But be careful because it does not have the same meaning as in English, because in English it is often used as a proposal to do something, but in Japanese it simply conveys a meaning of desire without any actions.

>A: おすしを食べたいですか。Do you want to eat sushi?
>B: ええ、食べたいです。Yes, I do (but I am not going to eat it now)
