In order to say that someone does something for someone a pattern `personに + verbてあげる` is used where the first verb is in its [て-form](52). Please refer to the あげる (to give) verb in [this article](165) for recap.
If a subject to whom the action is directed is not omitted it is supposed that the subject is the listener or the close relatives. The verb *あげる* is translated as *"to give"*, therefore, the meaning of the pattern may be translated as *"to do something and give it to someone"*.
>宿題を手伝っ**てあげます**。I will help you with your homework.
>綾子ちゃん**に**料理し**てあげます**。I cook for Ayako.

If a subject of the sentence is specified it means that the subject does something for someone else. Usually in this case both the subject and the person are specified in order to avoid confusion with [てくれる](118).
>綾子ちゃん**は**凛**に**宿題を手伝っ**てあげます**。Ayako helps Rin with her homework.
