A verb nominalisation is converting a verb into the *～ing form*, so that a verb becomes a noun. It was already mentioned in the [の particle](178) that it converts a verb into a noun, so another word which does the same function is `こと`. The form with *の* and *こと* is created in the same way, i.e. *の* or *こと* is added to a verb in the **causal form of the present tense**, so no past tense can be used with the nominalisation. The same is in English.
Cases when only *の*, *こと* and *ように* may be used are described below.
#### Only の
The main rule of using the *の particle* is the fact that both clauses (1 - where a verb is nominalised; 2 - which gives more details about the nominalised verb) occur at the same time or place. So the simplest explanation is that the *の particle* must be used whenever a nominalised clause is modified with an action (e.g. verbs or nouns like 聞こえる, 見える, 待つ, 好き etc.)
>公園で子供が遊ぶ**の**が見えました。I saw how children were playing in a park.
>あさみさんが宿題を終わる**の**を待っています。I'm waiting for Asami to finish her homework.
>日本語を勉強する**の**を手伝ってくれます。Help me with studying Japanese.
#### Only こと
*こと* does not imply that both clauses take place at the same time. Usages of *こと* are descried below.
- Communication of something (e.g. verbs like 話す - to say, 伝える - to report, etc.). In this case the first clause is still modified, but two actions do not occur at the same time or in the same place.
>学校を休む**こと**先生に伝えてくれます。
- A nominalised verb is followed by *だ*, *です** or *である*. It simply states a fact, so there is no meaning of time or place.
>趣味は日本語を勉強する**こと**です。My hobby is learning Japanese.
#### Using ように
Verb nominalisation with *ように* is usually used in conjunction with the verb *なる (to become)* as it is described in [this article](144) and it means the change of being able to do something which was not possible before. In this context other verb nominalization particles cannot be used since [ことになる](76) means that *"something has been decided for me"*, so the meaning is completely different. And のになる is ungrammatical.
>そのレストランでおすしを食べる**ように**なりました。Now I eat sushi at that restaurant.

As stated above now the speaker eats sushi at the restaurant, but before it was not possible for some reason. Therefore, this change is nominalised with *ように*.
