A verb nominalisation is converting a verb into the *～ing form*, so that a verb becomes a noun. It was already mentioned in the [の particle](178) that it converts a verb into a noun, so another word which does the same function is `事 (こと)`. The form with *の* and *事* is created in the same way, i.e. *の* or *事* is added to a verb in the **causal form of the present tense**, so no past tense can be used with the nominalisation. The same is in English.
Cases when only *の* or *事* may be used are described below.
#### Only の
The main rule of using the *の particle* is the fact that both clauses (1 - where a verb is nominalised; 2 - which gives more details about the nominalised verb) occur at the same time or place. So the simplest explanation is that the *の particle* must be used whenever a nominalised clause is modified with an action (e.g. verbs or nouns like 聞こえる, 見える, 待つ, 好き etc.)
>公園で子供が遊ぶ**の**が見えた。I saw how children were playing in a park.

>綾子ちゃんが宿題を終わる**の**を待ってる。I'm waiting for Ayako to finish her homework.

>日本語を勉強する**の**を手伝ってくれます。Help me with studying Japanese.
#### Only 事
*事* does not imply that both clauses take place at the same time. Usages of *事* are descried below.
- Communication of something (e.g. verbs like 話す - to say, 伝える - to report, etc.). In this case the first clause is still modified, but two actions do not occur at the same time or in the same place.
>学校を休む**事**先生に伝えてくれる。
- A nominalised verb is followed by *だ*, *です** or *である*. It simply states a fact, so there is no meaning of time or place.
>趣味は日本語を勉強する**事**だ。My hobby is learning Japanese.
