|Noun|N + だらけ|ゴミだらけだ|

>友達の部屋にはゴミ**だらけ**です。The friend's room is full of garbage.

In the first sentence the speakers expresses the negative feeling that the friend's room is dirty and full of garbage.
In the second sentence the speaker's negative feeling is determined by the fact that in the book there are a lot of kanji, so probably the speaker is not good at kanji yet and has troubles reading the book.
