In order to say that something is *too much* an expression `あまりに(も)` is used. This grammar point is similar to [すぎる](39) which modified adjectives, so *あまりに* can modify verbs as well (but **not** nouns) and it is places before a structure it modifies.
There is no particular difference between *あまりに* and *あまりにも*.
*あまりに* is also related to [あまり](54) in terms of *so much that*, but note that *あまりに* is placed before a verb, while *あまり* is placed after it.
