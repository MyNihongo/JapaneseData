In order to modify a verb with a meaning of *doing something together* a `verb stem + 合う` expression is used. It must be noted that modification with this pattern are not always natural and a word `一緒に` is more suitable for them, but whenever there is an interaction between two persons the *合う-pattern* may be used. Some verbs where the pattern is applied are mentioned in the table below.
