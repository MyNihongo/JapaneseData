In order to say that something is difficult to do a pattern `verb + にくいです` is used. To construct this form a verb must be in its stem form which is followed by the い-adjective *にくい*, therefore, the whole pattern can be conjugated in the same way as any い-adjective.
This form is the opposite of [verb + やすいです](138) which means *"it is easy to"*.
