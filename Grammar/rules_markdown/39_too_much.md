In order to say that something is in excess or too much a form `すぎる` is used after a verb or adjective. For adjectives the すぎる form is created by replacing the last syllable with すぎる. For verbs すぎる is follows a verb stem (*ます-form* without *ます*). Refer to a table below for the usage. すぎる is a verb of the 2 group.

|Form|Usage|
|-|-|
|1 group verb|飲み**すぎます**|
|2 group verb|食べ**すぎます**|
|い-adjective|寒**すぎます**|
|な-adjective|静か**すぎます**|

Due to the fact that すぎる is a verb (despite the fact that it can modify an adjective) it conjugates like verbs in the 2 group. Therefore, it is irrelevant of what is modified by すぎる the only part which is conjugated is only the すぎる verb.
>東京は高**すぎなせん**。Tokyo is not too much expensive.  
>昨日はお茶飲み**すぎました**。Yesterday I drank too much tea.

### Using with the て form
Usage of the [て form](52) in conjunction with すぎる is usually used in order to describe a reason.
>食べ**すぎて**、お腹が痛くなりました。I ate too much, so my stomach aches.

### Noun
すぎる is verb, but in order to express that something is too much a noun すぎ can also be used as shown in an example below.
>今日は暑**すぎ**ね。Today is too hot, right?

### Modern usage
Even though it is taught that すぎる has a negative meaning (and it is true) in the modern Japanese there are some expressions which express exactly the opposite. For example in comments words as `ヤバすぎる` or `すごすぎる` are often found. Even though すぎる is used there the words have a positive meaning.
