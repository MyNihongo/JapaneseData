In order to express the `looks like` idea in Japanese `そうです` is used, e.g. this expression is often used with the [ね particle](188). *"そうです"* is similar to [ようです](141) which also means *"it looks like"*, however, *"そうです"* is less certain than *"ようです"*.
Patterns how *"そうです"* is created are shown in the table below.

|Form|Usage|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Verb|V (~~ます~~) + そうだ|食べ**そうです**|
|い-adjective|イA (~~い~~) + そうだ|新し**そうです**|
|な-adjective|ナA (~~な~~) + そうだ|きれい**そうです**|
|noun|noun + そうだ|日本人**そうです**|

#### Verbs
>箱は落ち**そうです**。A box will fall now.

With verbs `そうです` has a slight nuance.
As for the example, imagine that the box is on the verge of a table and the box is shaking. When one looks at the box one recognises that the box is about to fall and it will fall in the next instant. In this case `落ちそうです` is used.

#### Adjectives
>母が作った晩ご飯はおいし**そうです**。Dinned which my mom cooked looks tasty.
>その文法は簡単**そうです**。This grammar looks easy.

With adjectives `そうです` has the standard meaning of *"looks like"*.

#### Nouns
>ジョンは日本人**そうですね**。

With nouns `そうです` has the standard meaning of *"looks like"*.
In this example there is the [ね particle](188) which states that the speaker seeks the confirmation whether or not John looks like Japanese.

### "Heard that" vs "Looks like"
**Note** that *"そうです"* can also mean [I heard that](110), but the patterns are different. *"I heard that"* uses the casual form while in *"it looks like"* the ending is dropped.
>雨が降り**そうです**。It will rain in the next instance.
>雨が降る**そうです**。I heard that it would rain.

The first sentence (*"looks like"*) has the verb stem before it while the second sentence (*"I heard that"*) has the dictionary form of a verb before it.
