In order to say that something looks like something a pattern `object1は + object2みたいだ` is used where the *object1* looks like the *object2*. When *みたいだ* is used with verbs its meaning changes a bit to *"it seems"*. It has the same meaning as [ようだ](141), but *ようだ* is usually used in writing while *みたいだ* is used in speaking both in the formal and casual context.
