The expression `わけではない` is used to express the speaker's disagreement with the statement. It can be translated as *"it is not like this"* and is used mainly in these situations:
- say that something is not completely true
- deny something

|Form|Usage|Example|

|な-adjective|ナA + **である**わけではない|きれいである**わけではない**|
|Noun|N + **である**わけではない|日本人である**わけではない**|

>漢字が読めない**わけではない**です。It is not true that I cannot read kanji.
>あの人は忙しい**わけではない**です。It is not true that he is busy.

In the first example denies the fact that he or she cannot read kanji. So it is still possible that the speaker cannot read some kanji, but there are kanji which the speaker is able to read.
The second example has the similar meaning, i.e. that person might be busy, but there are times he or she has some free time. So that person is busy, but not all the time.

Despite being very similar to [わけがない](251) the difference is that わけがない is a commonly accepted fact which shows that something is absolutely not true while わけではない expresses the disagreement. With わけがない the statement still might be true, but not completely. Let us compare these sentences.
>あの人日本人の**わけではない**です。It is not true that that person is Japanese.
>あの人日本人の**わけがない**です。There is no way that person is Japanese.

The first sentence (わけではない) simply expresses the disagreement with the statement that the person is Japanese while the second sentence (わけがない) completely denies it.
