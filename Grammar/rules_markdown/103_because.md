Particles [から and ので](18) are used to provide only a single reason, so when there are several reasons the `し` particle is used to connect all reasons together. Another common usage of *し* is emphasising that a provided reason is not the only one and there are some more which the speaker deliberately omits.
The particle is used differently with verbs, nouns and adjectives, so it is shown in the table below.

|Form|Pattern|Example|
