In order to say that something ends before another event a `までに` particle is used. In English it is an equivalent of the preposition *by* with the time reference (e.g. "by Wednesday", "by 3 o'clock", etc.). The *までに particle* is used with verbs in the affirmative form and nouns, so the pattern is in the table below.

|Type|Form|
|-|-|
|Verbs|dictionary form + までに|
|Nouns|noun + までに|

>僕が買える**までに**宿題を終わったほうがいい。It would be better if you finish your homework by the time I come home.
>
>午後十一時**までに**帰ってくれる。Please return home by 11 P.M.

#### までに vs まで
Both までに and [まで](22) may indicate completion by the specified time (e.g. by Friday), but the difference is that `まで` ends the clause, but after `までに` there is a next clause indicating what needs to be done.

##### Correct usage of `までに`
>金曜日**までに**宿題を提出してください。Please submit the homework until Friday.
>
>金曜日**まで**宿題を提出してください。(✕) Wrong.

>宿題はいつ**までに**すればいいですか。Until when should we complete the homework?
>
>宿題はいつ**まで**すればいいですか。(✕) Wrong.

In these examples there is a second clause after までに which indicates a request, therefore, まで cannot be used here.

##### Correct usage of `まで`
>宿題は金曜日**まで**です。This homework is until Friday.
>
>宿題は金曜日**までに**です。(✕) Wrong.

In this example the sentence ends with まで, therefore, までに cannot be used here.
