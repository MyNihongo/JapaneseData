Japanese is known for its politeness  and respect when it comes to requests and orders, but there are situations when long  expressions are not convenient to use to request actions. In these situations (examples will follow shortly) an imperative form is used. Rules how the imperative form is created are shown in the table below.

||Affirmative|Negative|
|-|-|-|
|1 group|vいます➝vえ|v辞書形 + な|
|2 group|vます➝vろ|v辞書形 + な|
|する|しろ|するな|
|来る(くる)|来い(こい)|来るな(くるな)|

For the negative form the rule is the same for all groups, i.e. add `な` after the dictionary form. For the affirmative form rules are different:

- 1 group: replace the last *う* vowel with *え*, e.g. (く➝け, す➝せ, む➝め, etc.)
- 2 group: replace the last *る* syllable with *ろ*

||Affirmative|Negative|
|-|-|-|
|to buy|買**え**|買う**な**|
|to eat|食べ**ろ**|食べる**な**|

Let us look at examples when the imperative form is used.
#### Emergency situations
>（地震のとき）机の中に入**れ**。(Earthquake) Go under the desk!

In emergency situations (earthquake, tsunami, robbery, etc.) there is no time to ask polite requests, therefore, in Japanese there are imperative requests which are not long to say. Instructions in emergency situations must be followed so it is not a matter of being polite.

#### Angry at someone
>何も言う**な**。Don't say anything!

When a person A is angry at a person B, the person A does want to express the anger, so being polite is not appropriate for these situations. It is natural that the person A is strict in his or her orders.

#### Sports
>頑張**れ**。早く走**れ**。Come on! Run faster!

When a sports fan supports an individual or a team the fan does not need to be polite. To cheer up and encourage the sports team the fan uses the imperative form.

#### Violence
>泥棒：お金くれ**ろ**。Robber: Gimme the money.

When robber steals something from someone else it makes no sense to be polite *"Please kindly give me your money"*. Therefore, those who commit violence use the imperative form.

#### Doing something bad at work
>会議室でタバコを吸う**な**。Don't smoke in the meeting room!

Restrictions and regulations at work must be obeyed and it is bad to break the rules. In order to emphasise that it is mandatory the imperative form is used.
