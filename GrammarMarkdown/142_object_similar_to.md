In order to say that an object is similar to another object a word `ような + noun` is used where *ような* is a な-adjective which modifies the noun. This pattern is the same as [みたいな](83), but the difference is that *みたいな* is used in speaking while *ような* is used mostly in writing.
If another noun is used before *ような* it means *"looks like"*, but verbs and adjectives can be used as well, so in this case the meaning is rather *"like"*. Again a noun must be connected with the *の particle* and a な-adjective retains the last *な*.
