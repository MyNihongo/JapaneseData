In order to say that something will happen in the next moment a phrase `verb + そうです` is used. It can be translated as *"look, this will happen now"*.
To create this form add `そうです` to a verb stem. *そうです* is a な-adjective.

>箱は落ち**そうです**。A box will fall now.

As for the example, imagine that the box is on the verge of a table and the box is shaking. When one looks at the box one recognises that the box is about to fall and it will fall in the next instant. In this case `落ちそうです` is used.
