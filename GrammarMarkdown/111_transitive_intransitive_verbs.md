Understanding a distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs is crucial. Here is a definition:
- transitive - verb which accepts one or multiple objects (e.g. I open a windows)
- intransitive - verb which does not accept any objects (e.g. a windows is open)

In English a pair of transitive and intransitive verbs is usually the same verb (e.g. *to open* as in the definition above), but in Japanese these verbs are different, therefore, it is imperative to learn which verbs are transitive and which are intransitive and not to confuse them.
An important grammar note is that with intransitive verbs a subject is **always** used with the ***が** particle*.
Below is a table of common transitivity pairs in Japanese, but there are a lot more.

|Translation|Transitive (subject)|Intransitive (object)|
|-|-|-|
|to break|壊す (こわす)|壊れる (こわれる)|
|to turn off|消す (けす)|消える (きえる)|
|to turn on|つける|つく|
|to open|開ける (あける)|開く (あく)|
|to close|閉める (しめる)|閉まる (しまる)|
|to begin|始める (はじめる)|始まる (はじまる)|
|to drop / to fall|落とす (おとす)|落ちる (おちる)|
|to lose / to disappear|無くす (なくす)|無くなる (なくなる)|
|to put in / to enter|入れる (いれる)|入る (はいる)|
|to take out / to get out|出す (だす)|出る (でる)|

>昨日新しいパソコン**が壊れた**。Yesterday my new computer broke.
>
>昨日新しいパソコンを**壊した**。Yesterday I broke my new computer.

One can see in the table that both transitive and intransitive can be either a う- or a る-verb, bet there are still some verb ending patterns (please note that they are **not valid in all cases**) which can be used to memorise pairs:

|Transitive ending|Intransitive ending|
|-|-|
|～る (消え**る**)|～す (消**す**)|
|～まる (閉**まる**)|～める (閉**める**)|
|～く (開**く**)|～ける (開**ける**)|

#### State of an object
If an **intransitive** (without a subject) verb is changed into its [ている-form](44) it will indicate a state of an object (e.g. a door is open at the moment). Be careful with transitive verbs because it will indicate an ongoing action (e.g. I am opening a door at the moment).
>ドアー**が**開**いてる**。The door is open. (開く → 開いてる, が instead of を)
>
>ドアー**を**開け**ている**。I'm opening the door. (開ける → 開けている)

#### Result of an action
If a **transitive** (with a subject) verb is changed into its [てある-form](43) it will indicate a state of an object (e.g. someone has opened a door and it is open).
>寒いから、窓を閉めて**ありますか**。(It is cold, so I have closed the window)
