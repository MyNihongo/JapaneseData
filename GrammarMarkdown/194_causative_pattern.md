The standard pattern for the causative form is `Aは + Bに + verbあせる`, but depending on whether a verb is transitive (を + verb) or intransitive (が + verb) this pattern may differ. Let us take a look at the patterns.

#### Intransitive verbs
When intransitive verbs (が + verb) are used an object of the causative form might have both を and に particles depending on the meaning:
- `に particle` - to let do
- `を particle` - to make do

>私は学校に行き**たい**です。母は私**に**学校に行かせました。I want to go to school. My mom let me go to school.
>
>私は学校に行き**たくない**です。母は私**を**学校に行かせました。I don't want to go to school. My mom made mo go to school.

In the first example I do want to go to school and since I was allowed to go the `に` particle is used (my mom let me go).
In the second example I do **not** want to go to school, but it was mandatory to go, therefore, the `を` particle is used (my mom made me go).

#### Transitive verbs
When transitive verbs (を + verb) are used an object of the causative form is used only with the に particle in both bases, therefore, the meaning can only be guess from the context:
- `を particle` - to let do
- `を particle` - to make do

This is due to the fact that in Japanese it is no allowed to repeat the を particle twice in the same clause.
>母は私**に**薬**を**飲ませました。Mom made me drink the medicine.
>
>母は私**を**薬**を**飲ませました。(✕) wrong grammar

In the first example the を particle is used only once, therefore, grammar is correct. However, in the second example the を particle is used twice, so grammar is wrong.
It is reasonable to assume that I do not like drinking medicine, therefore, we concluded that mom **made** me drink it.
