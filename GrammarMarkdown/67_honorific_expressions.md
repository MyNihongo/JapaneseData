Honorific expressions (尊敬語) are the most polite expressions which are used to exalt the subject of the sentence, therefore, the position of the subject becomes higher while the position of others (usually the speaker) remains below the position of the subject. Therefore, the honorific expressions are used for describing other persons' actions and never for own actions.
The common rules are described in this article, but the special verbs are in [this article](187).

#### Honorific form
The rule for う- and る-verbs is the same, i.e. `お + verb stem + になります`, but it becomes difficult with *する* verbs because the prefix can be either `お` or `ご` and there is no rule for that. So the prefix must be memorised. The `ご` prefix is used more often than the `お` prefix.
||Dictionary form|Honorific|
|-|-|-|
|う-verbs|話す|**お**話し**になります**|
|る-verbs|食べる|**お**食べ**になります**|
|する-verbs (1)|散歩する|**お**散歩**になります**|
|する-verbs (2)|電話する|**ご**電話**になります**|

`来る` is a special word which is not used in the standard honorific form. See [this article](187) for special words.

>先生は生徒と**お**話し**になります**。Teacher talks with students.
>先生は昼ごはんを**お**食べ**になります**。Teacher eats lunch.
>先生は公園で**お**散歩**になります**。Teacher walks in a park.
>先生は**ご**電話**になります**。Teacher talks on the phone.

**Note**: when a verb stem consists only of a single kana (not kanji) character the honorific expression cannot be created. For example the verb stem of the verb *見る* is *見 (み)*, therefore, the honorific form cannot be created. On the contrary the verb stem of *飲む* is *飲み (のみ)*, therefore, the honorific form can be *お飲みになる*.

#### Passive voice form
The passive voice form is just an alternative to the standard honorific form, there is no real difference in sematic.
The [passive voice](137) form is created by adding `あれる` to the verb (e.g. 話す➝話される, 食べる➝食べられる, する➝される, etc.). When the honorific form is created the whole sentence is **not** transformed into the passive voice only the verb is. Therefore, it differs from the actual passive voice as shown in the example below.

>**先生は**お茶を飲まれます。Teacher drinks tea (honorific, not passive voice).
>
>**お茶は**先生に飲まれます。Tea is drunk by a teacher (passive voice, not honorific).

Let us rewrite the example from the standard honorific form into the passive voice form.
**Note**: for *する* verbs the honorific prefix is still present.

>先生は生徒と話**されます**。Teacher talks with students.
>先生は昼ごはんを食べ**られます**。Teacher eats lunch.
>先生は公園で散歩**されます**。Teacher walks in a park.
>先生は**ご**電話**されます**。Teacher talks on the phone.
