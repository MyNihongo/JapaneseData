In order to say that something or someone is similar to another object or person by **characteristics** an い-adjective `らしい` is used. A similar expression was [みたいな](83), but the key difference is that *みたいな* is similar by appearance (outer), but *らしい* - by characteristics (inner).
*らしい* can be conjugated into a negative form or an adverb.
>綾子ちゃん**らしい**人が好き。I like persons like Ayako.

>田中さんは山田先生**らしく**説明した。Tanaka explained like a teacher.
