In order to say that something ends before another event a `までに` particle is used. In English it is an equivalent of the preposition *by* with the time reference (e.g. "by Wednesday", "by 3 o'clock", etc.). The *までに particle* is used with verbs in the affirmative form and nouns, so the pattern is in the table below.

|Type|Form|

|Verbs|dictionary form + までに|
|Nouns|noun + までに|

Previously there was a [まで particle](22) which means *until*, so the key difference is that:
- まで: A ends and B starts right away
- までに: A ends and B does not necessarily start right away
