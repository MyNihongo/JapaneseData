In order to ask someone to do something for the speaker a pattern `てもらえませんか` is used. The pattern is composed of a verb in its [て-form](52), a verb *もらう* which means *"to receive"* and the [か particle](5) which creates a question. Note that *もらう* is in the negative **potential** form (the [potential form](97) means *"can do"*), so
>もら**え**ませんか - all right, potential form is used
>(✕)もら**い**ませんか - **WRONG**, no potential form

So be careful and use the potential form of the verb *もらう* in order to ask for something.
The meaning of *てもらえませんか* is similar to [てください](46), but the usage is different. *てください* is used **only** in tests and public requests, while *てもらえませんか* is used in a direct request to a person. If one uses *てください* directly with another person it will be considered **rude**.
>少し手伝っ**てもらえませんか**。Could you help me a bit?

It is also possible to use [humble expressions](67) and replace the verb *もらう* with `いただく`. Note that the potential form remains, so it is *いただ**け**ませんか* and not *(✕)いただ**き**ませんか*. **いただけませんか** is the most polite way to ask for something.
