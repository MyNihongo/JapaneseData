In order to say that someone tries something a pattern `verbて + みる` is used. The patterns consists of a verb in its [て-form](52) and a verb *見る* in hiragana, so the pattern can be translated as *"I will do it and see"* which is close enough to the verb *"to try"*. The semantics of the pattern is either of the following:
- I will try it for the first time
- I know it's hard, so I will try it
>独学で日本語を勉強し**てみる**。I will try to study Japanese on my own.

There are also other ways how to say to try and below are explanations of differences:
- [ようにする](145) - to try something as a new habit from now on
- [ようとする](-1) - to try something and not achieve the expected result (usually used in the past tense)
