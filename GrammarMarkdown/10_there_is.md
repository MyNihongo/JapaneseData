In order to say that there is something (non-living thing) or that someone has something a structure `Xがある` is used, so the formula is *noun* + *が* + *verb ある*. In order to say that there is someone (living thing) a structure `Xがいる` is used, so the same formula except that the final verb is *いる*. The final verb can be conjugated in positive and negative forms (to indicate that something or someone is not there).
*Note*: a casual negative form of ある is **ない** (not あらない)
Examples of *ある*:
>新しいパソコンがあります。I have a new computer.
>それをする必要がない。It is not necessary to do it.

Examples of *いる*:
>猫がいる。I have a cat.
>夜は町で人間がいません。At night there are no people in the town.
