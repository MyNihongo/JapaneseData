`ば` is the common conditional pattern which can be used in all cases except those covered in [と](90) and [なら](184).
The `ば` conditional is the polite counterpart of [たら](185) except that `ば` does not the *"when"* meaning, i.e. `ば` should be used in the polite context while `たら` is used in the causal context. Otherwise there is no difference between these two forms.
Patterns how to create the *ば-form* are explained in [this article](55).

#### Conditional
>東京に行け**ば**、プレセントを買ってきてください。 When you go to Tokyo, please bring me back a present.

#### What to do
>どうすれ**ば**、日本語を話すのが上手になれます？ What should I do in order to improve my speaking?

In this example the `は` form is used to ask for advice, i.e. `どうすれば` is translated as *"what should I do if A"*. The A clause is usually in the [potential form](97), but the present tense is also fine.
