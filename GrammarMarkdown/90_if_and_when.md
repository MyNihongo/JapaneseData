There are quite a lot of ways to say *"if"* or *"when"* in Japanese depending on the context, so the forms themselves and their key distinctions are explained below.

|Form|Usage|Affirmative|Negative|
|-|-|-|-|
|たら|past casual form + ら|食べ**たら**|食べなかっ**たら**|
|ば|ば-form|食べ**れば**|食べな**ければ**|

For more usages see [this article](167).
## ば (rather if than when)
Patterns how to create the *ば-form* are explained in [this article](55).
This form replaces the *たら-form* in the formal context (remember that *たら* is used only in the casual context), therefore, the *ば-form* also means that the second clause occurs after the first clause. Like *時* the *ば-form* puts emphasis on the first clause (the reason), therefore, *ば* sentences make it sound like tha A clause is the only way how to achieve the B clause.
The past tense cannot be used with *ば*.
>お金があれ**ば**、日本に行く。If only I had money I would go to Japan.

>もっと勉強すれ**ば**、日本語が上手になるよ。If I study more my Japanese will improve.

*Note*: when *ば* is used the second clause must be good, therefore, it does not sound natural if something bad occurs in the second clause.
>アイスを食べれ**ば**、幸せになる。If I eat an ice cream I become happy.

>(✕)アイスを食べれ**ば**、お腹が痛くなる。If I eat an ice cream my stomach hurts. (**DO NOT** use this form, use *たら* instead)

The *ば-form* is also used for asking for pieces of advice with an expression *"What should I do in order to"*. In this case a question word `どうすれば` which literally means *what should I do if*.
>どうすれ**ば**、日本語を話すのが上手になる？ What should I do in order to improve my speaking?

Usually only stating a fact can be used with *ば*, however, if an adjective or *ある* and *いる* verbs are in the *ば-form* only then the second clause may be different that simply stating a fact (e.g. request).
>寒けれ**ば**、ストーブつけて。If it is cold turn on a heater.

*Note*: even though it is possible to construct a *ば-form* with a *な-adjective*, this sounds very formal, therefore, when speaking *な-adjectives* are usually used with *たら* (even though *たら* has a casual context).
