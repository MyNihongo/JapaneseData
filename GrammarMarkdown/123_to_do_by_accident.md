In order to say that someone does something by accident a pattern `verbて + しまいます` or `verbて + しまいません` (for negative) is used. In some books it is taught that *てしまいます* has a meaning of finishing something completely, but only with verbs like *する* or *やる* where an action of doing something is applied (or 終わる,読む, etc.). With other verbs only the meaning of doing something unintentionally is used.
Depending on the formality of the context different forms are used.

|Context|Verb|Pattern|Example|
|-|-|-|-|
|Formal|All|verbて + しまいます|食べ**てしまいます**|
|Informal|て-form with **て**|verbて - て + ちゃう|食べ**ちゃう**|
|Informal|て-form with **で**|verbで - で + じゃう|急い**じゃう**|

>宿題を忘れ**てしまいました**。I forgot my homework (and regret it).
>宿題を全部やっ**てしまいました**。I finished my homework.
>宿題を全部やっ**てしまいます**。I am finishing my homework.

To sum up the table the form *しまう* (informal context) is rarely used in sophisticated Japanese, therefore, in the formal context use *てしまいます* with the *ます* ending, but in the informal context use *ちゃう* or *じゃう*.
>宿題がたくさんあるのに、友達と遊ん**じゃった**。Even though I have a lot of homework I played with my friends.

>ケータイ壊し**ちゃった**。I broke my phone.
