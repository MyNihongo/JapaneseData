In order to express things like *"to make someone do"* or *"to let someone do"* (i.e. the causative form) a conjugation form `あせる` of verbs is used. Which of these two expressions can only be confirmed by the context, but sometimes even the context does not make the sense unequivocal. The pattern of the form is `Aは + Bに + verbあせる` (notice that the *に particle* is used), where:
- A - subject (the one who makes someone do)
- B - object (the one who is made doing)

う- and る-verbs differ in how the *あせる-form* is created. For う-verbs the last う-vowel is replaces with *あせる*, therefore, the last consonant and *あ* make a syllable (く → か + せる). For る-verbs the final *る* is replaced with *させる*. The pattern is shown in the table below.

|Form|Pattern|Example|
|-|-|-|
|る-verbs|～させる|食べ**させる**|
|う-verbs|～あせる|飲**ませる**|
|する|させる||
|来る (くる)|来**させる** (こさせる)||

More examples for う-verbs are in the next table. The only peculiar verb group is the one which ends with *う* because like in the casual negative form the last *う* is replaced with *わ*, so the causative form is *わせる*.

|う-verb|Dictionary form|Potential form|
|-|-|-|
|～う|買う|買**わせる**|
|～つ|待つ|待**たせる**|
|～る|取る|取**らせる**|
|～む|読む|読**ませる**|
|～ぶ|叫ぶ|叫**ばせる**|
|～ぬ|死ぬ|死**なせる**|
|～く|書く|書**かせる**|
|～ぐ|急ぐ|急**がせる**|
|～す|話す|話**させる**|

>弟に宿題を**させた**。I made my younger brother do my homework. (Theoretically, if the younger brother likes doing the homework the sentence could be translated as *"I **let** my younger brother do my homework"*)

>友達に僕先にパーティーに行**かせた**。I let my friends go to the party without me.
