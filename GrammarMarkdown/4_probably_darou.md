The primary meaning of `でしょう` is expressing that something most certainly is the case. When saying *でしょう* the speaker has a reason to be certain that this is the case, but the speaker does not state it as a fact. *でしょう* can be used after nouns, adjectives and verbs in positive and negative forms. Only the present tense is used, i.e. no past tense with the *でしょう* form.
*でしょう* is used in the formal context and it is also common to drop the final う in speaking, so the form becomes *でしょ*. In the casual context *だろう* is used. The following examples are with the *でしょう-form*, but any of the forms of this paragraph can be applied to the examples.
