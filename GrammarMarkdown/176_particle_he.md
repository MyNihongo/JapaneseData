The `へ` particle indicates a direction. On the contrary to the [に particle](176) which is usually used in speaking the `へ` particle is commonly used in writing. Otherwise there is no real difference between the two particles.
The `へ` particle is pronounced as *e* not as *he*.

>東京**へ**行きます。I will go to Tokyo.
