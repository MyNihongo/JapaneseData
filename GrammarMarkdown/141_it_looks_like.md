In order to say that something looks like a pattern `clause + ようです` is used. It has the same meaning as [みたいだ](82) and [に見える](92), but the difference is that *ようだ* is more formal and is usually used only in writing, therefore, it is not used with a casual ending *だ*. The grammar construction is created differently. Just like with *みたいだ* if *ようです* is used with a verb the meaning of the clause changes to *"it seems"*.
