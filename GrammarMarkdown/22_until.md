A word `まで` has various subtly different meanings, but the unified idea si to express the final point of something. Meanings of *まで* are *until* and *to*.
>今日**から**日曜日**まで**忙しい。I will be busy from today until Sunday.
>ここ**から**東京**まで**時間がかかる。It will take two hours from here to Tokyo.

The *まで particle* is usually used with verbs *送る*, *見送る* or *送って行く* which mean *to see off*.
>家**まで**送ってあげる。I will take you home.

There is a set phrase in Japanese when asking someone to bring you somewhere - `placeまで + お願いします`. It can be mistaken for the *に particle*, but in fact the *まで particle* is used.
>映画館**までお願いします**。To the cinema, please.
