In order to say that something has already been decided and it is scheduled for some time in the future a pattern `clause + 予定だ` is used. It has a similar usage as [つもり](49), but the key difference is that *予定だ* is used to talk about certain things which the speaker prepares to, while *つもり* is used for a more abstract idea without any solid ground.
This pattern can be applied to verbs and nouns. With verbs there are no additional particles, but a noun must be connected to *予定だ* with the *の particle*.

|Form|Pattern|Example|
|-|-|-|
|Verb|casual + 予定だ|行く**予定だ**|
|Noun|noun + の + 予定だ|旅行**の予定だ**|

>日本で働く為に、日本に行く**予定だ**。In order to work in Japan I plan to go there (e.g. I have already bought a ticket).

Intentions can be explained with either [つもり](49) or [verbおう + と思ってる](146), but *予定* implies a 100%-certain actions while there is more uncertainty in other options.
