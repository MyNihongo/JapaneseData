### から
In order to provide explanations or clarifications a sentence-ending particle `から` is used. When *から* follows い-adjectives or verbs then *から* is used by itself, however, when *から* is used with な-adjectives or nouns there must be `だ` before *から*.
Please note that the **short form** is used before *から* (the same rule as for *ので*).
>日本が面白い**から**、日本語を勉強してる。I study Japanese because Japan is interesting.
>日本に行きたい**から**、日本語を勉強してる。I study Japanese because I want to go to Japan.
>アニメが好き**だから**、日本語を勉強してる。I study Japanese because I like anime.
>日本人だ**から**、日本語を勉強してる。I study Japanese because I am Japanese.

*Note*: *から* is tent to be used to address objectives reasons, so using *から* for subjective reasons might sound rude. For example, if one explains that something happens because of him or her *から* is not a good choice, it is imperative to use *ので*. This rule applies when the speaker wants to be polite, so in the casual context *から* is still all right for subjective reasons.
>体調が悪い**から**、パーティーに行けない。I cannot go to a party because I'm sick. (**RUDE!!!**)
>体調が悪い**ので**、パーティーに行けない。I cannot go to a party because I'm sick.

Due to the fact that it provides clarifications it is often used with the [ん-form](34) which is a more advanced topic.
>今日は学校を休む。頭が痛いんだ**から**。I won't go to school today. I have headaches.
>頭が痛いんだ**から**、今日は学校を休む。Because I have headaches I won't go to school today.

When one participates in an interview or teaching something it is common to use a `からです` expression, i.e. using a causal *から-form*, but ending it with *です* to make it formal again. Therefore, using *からです* in a normal speech might sound annoying because the one who uses it tries to teach something.
>どうして日本に行きましたか。Why did you come to Japan?
>日本の文化が好き**だからです**。Because I like Japanese culture.

Another meaning of *から* is "from" or "since", however in this case *から* is not a sentence-ending particle, but just a particle.
>綾子ちゃん**から**そんな事が聞こえるのはおかしだ。It's strange to hear this from Ayako.
>これ**から**一緒に遊ぼう。Let's play together from now on.
>去年**から**友達だ。We've been friends since last year.
### ので (んで)
A word `ので` is also translated as *because*, but it sounds more formal than *から*. An important note about the *ので* is that it is not used with *ます-forms* only with casual forms. With な-adjectives and nouns *な* connects them with *ので*.
>体調が悪い**ので**、仕事に行けない。I cannot go to a party because I'm sick.
>電車が遅れた**ので**、遅れました。I am late because my train was late.
>元気**なので**、出かけれる。I can go outside because I am cheerful.
>日本人**なので**、東京に行きました。I went to Tokyo because I am Japanese.
