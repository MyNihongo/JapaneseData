When asking for help (or assistance) in Japanese there is a sentence-final phrase `んですが`(please see [this article](34) for how to create the *んです* form). So the sentence `A + んですが。` means *"I don't know how to A, so please help me"*. Let us take a look at some examples.

#### Ask for help (1)
>この漢字がわからない**んですが**。I don't understand this kanji.

In this example a person does not understand a kanji character says it with *んですが*, which means that the person is asking for help. For clarity this is the complete sentence *"この漢字がわからないんですが、教えていただけませんか。"*, but since it is clear that the person is asking for help, the second clause of the sentence is omitted.

#### Ask for help (2)
>手を洗いたい**んですが**。I would like to wash my hand.

In this example a person does not know where the lavatory is. It might be tempting to ask `お手洗いはどこですか。 (where is the lavatory?)` and Japanese people will understand you, but Japanese people are not so direct, so they will express their wish with *んですが* which would imply a request for help because the person does not know something in order to do it.
Therefore, in the example below the person expresses a wish to wash hands, but the person does not know where to go.

#### Pointing out a mistake
In these examples a person points out some else's mistake, but since in Japan it is rude to point it out directly a phrase `と思うんですが` is used to indicate a mistake.

>先生が宿題がないと言ったと**思うんですが**。There was no homework.

In the first example a teacher said that there would be no homework, but on the next day the teacher asks for the homework. It is not polite to say *"先生がダメですよ" (you are not right)*, so instead it is more appropriate to say *"I think there was no homework"* with *んですが*.

>そこは私の座席だと**思うんですが**。This is my seat.

In the second example, imagine that when one comes to a movie theater there is someone sitting on one's seat. A polite way to indicate a mistake is by saying *"I think it is my seat"*.
