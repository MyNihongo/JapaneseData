In order to say that the speaker heard something a pattern `clause + と聞いた` is used which consists of the *と particle* which connects the clause to a verb *聞く (to hear)* in the past tense, so the literal translation is the exact meaning of the pattern, i.e. *"I heard that"*. The pattern has the same meaning as [そうだ-form](110) with a clause.
