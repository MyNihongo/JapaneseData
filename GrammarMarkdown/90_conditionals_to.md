In order to say that *"if A, then B **always** occurs"* the `と` particle is used in the `A(casual form)とB` where A is in the causal form. Please note, that in the second clause (after *と*) **only the present tense** is used, other forms (questions, suggestions, etc.) are not natural. The `と` conditional is used mainly in the following situations:

#### Machines
When machines work as expected (not taking into account defects) their actions are usually expected (e.g. push the button then something happens).

>自動販売機のボタンを押す**と**、飲み物が出る。If you push the button on the vending machine, a drink will come out.

#### Directions
Planning of locations does not change often, therefore, it is expected to arrive to a certain destination when following a certain path.

>左に曲がって、まっすぐ行く**と**、渋谷駅がある。If you turn left and go straight, there will be the Shibuya station.

#### Seasons
If we do not take into account the latest climate changes usually it is expected to meet certain weather in certain seasons (e.g. snow in winter, sunshine in summer, etc.).

>冬がなる**と**、雪が降ります。When winter comes, it snows.

#### Feelings
When people talk about how they feel in response to other people's feelings the `と` particle is used.

>あさみさんが嬉しい**と**、私も。If Asami is happy, so am I.
