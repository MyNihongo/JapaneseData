`なら` particle is used only in specific situations which are listed below. The pattern of the form is `A(casual form)なら、B`.

#### Giving advice, recommendations
>東京を観光する**なら**、スカイツリーがいいですよ。If you go sight seeing in Tokyo, Skytree is great.
>日本に行く**なら**、電車で電話しないほうがいいですよ。If you go to Japan, do not talk on the train.

The clause before *なら* is the topic of the advice and the clause after *なら* is the advice itself.

#### Express ideas, thoughts
>A: 日本語能力試験２できる？ Can you do the JLPT N2?
>B: N3**なら**、できる。No, but I can do N3.

In this example a person A asks a person B whether or not he or she is able to complete the JLPT N2. Since the person B does not know it he or she expresses the thought about the N3 level, i.e. *"if it were N3 I could make it"*.

#### Wishes
>日本語が上手になりたい**なら**、もっと勉強しなきゃ。If you want to improve your Japanese, you must study more.

In this example the wish is to become good at Japanese. Therefore, this usage quite similar to giving advice, e.g. *"if you wish A then B"*.
