In order to make humble forms more respectful (or when the verb stem consists of a single syllable) special verbs are used. `Indirect` humble expressions mean that another person is not directly involved in the action, but the action is still performed for the sake of the person (e.g. the person asked me to do something, so I do it out of respect).

>お弁当をお買いします。I buy a lunch box.

In this example (standard form) someone who I respect asked to buy a lunch box. Even though this person is not directly involved in the action, the result of this action is directed to the person. Therefore, it is all right to use the `indirect humble expression`.
In the table below there are special verbs for indirect humble expressions.
