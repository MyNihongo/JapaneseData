In order to say that there is something and nothing more a word `ばかり` (sometimes is spelled as *ばっかり*) is used. In English it is translated as *nothing but* and it usually expresses a shock or surprise, sometimes in a negative way.
Commonly ばかり is used only with nouns, but it is speculated that ばかり might also be used with verbs as well (so the form will be *て-form* of the verb + ばかり), but usually when a verb is used with *ばかり* another form is used and it is [ばかりいる](-1) which is another topic. Therefore, it is all right to use *ばかり* only with nouns.
>テレビ**ばかり**見てる。I do nothing but watching TV.

>友達のペットの中で猫**ばっかり**がいる。Among pets of my friend there are only cats. (i.e. no dogs, hamsters, parrots, etc.)
