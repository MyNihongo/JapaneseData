If the [causative form](99) is combined with the [passive voice](137) expressions as *"to be made doing"* or *"to be let doing"* can be used and the form is `あせられる` which consists of `あせる (causative) + あれる (passive)` where the last *る* of *あせる* is replaced with * あれる*. Technically it is a combination of two forms, but it is worth highlighting it.
The pattern of the form is `Aは + Bに + verbあせられる` (notice that the *に particle* is used), where:
- A - subject (the one who is made doing)
- B - object (the one who makes someone do)

Due to the fact that the form starts with the causative part it becomes quite clear that the form is created in exactly the same way, but instead of *あせる* there will be *あせられる*. As a recap the pattern for verbs is in the table below.

|Form|Pattern|Example|
|-|-|-|
|る-verbs|～させられる|食べ**させられる**|
|う-verbs|～あせられる|飲**ませられる**|
|する|させられる||
|来る (くる)|来**させられる** (こさせられる)||

More examples for う-verbs are in the next table. Again the only peculiar verb group is the one which ends with *う* because like in the casual negative form the last *う* is replaced with *わ*, so the causative form is *わせられる*.

|う-verb|Dictionary form|Potential form|

|～う|買う|買**わせられる**|
|～つ|待つ|待**たせられる**|
|～る|取る|取**らせられる**|
