In order to report that the speaker heard something a pattern `clause + そうです` is used where the clause is in the casual form (both past and present tense are allowed).

|Form|Example (present tense)|
|-|-|
|verb|食べる**そうです**|
|noun|日本人**だ**そうです|
|い-adjective|おいしいそうです|
|な-adjective|静か**だ**そうです|

>明日、雨が降る**そうです**。I heard that it would rain tomorrow.
>
>ジョンさんは日本人**だそうです**。I heard that John was Japanese.
>
>日本の料理がおいしいい**そうです**。I heard that Japanese food was delicious.
>
>東京が静か**だそうです**。I heard that Tokyo was quiet.

#### `Heard that` vs `Looks like`
In the *"I heard that"-sentences* the clause retains its ending while in *"it looks like"-sentences* the ending is dropped (verb stem).
>雨が降り**そうです**。It will rain in the next instance.
>
>雨が降る**そうです**。I heard that it would rain tomorrow.
