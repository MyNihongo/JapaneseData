In order to report that the speaker heard something a pattern `clause + そうだ` is used.

|Pattern|Example|
|-|-|
|I heard that|食べ**た**そう|

In the *"I heard that"-sentences* the clause retains its ending while in *"it looks like"-sentences* the ending is dropped.
>綾子ちゃんが結婚してる**そうだ**。I heard that Ayako is married.
