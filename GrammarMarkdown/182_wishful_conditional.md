When Japanese people reject an offer because of inability to do it (lack of something) the wishful conditional form `A ば-form + B (potential form) んですが` is used. Rules how it create the ば-form are described in [this article](55). The second clause consists of a verb in the [potential form](97) and [んですが](170) which expresses the speaker's emotions.
This phrase can be translated as *"If I had A then I would B"*.

>A：東京に行きませんか。Let's go to Tokyo?
>B：ちょっと。お金があれ**ば**、行ける**んですが**。I cannot. If I had money I would go.

Japanese people do not reject offers in a direct manner, so in the example above a person A asks a person B to go together to Tokyo. The person B does not have enough money, but it is **not right** to say *"いいえ、行けません"* (too harsh), therefore, a friendlier structure is used, i.e. *"Sorry, I would like to go, but unfortunately I have no money"*.
