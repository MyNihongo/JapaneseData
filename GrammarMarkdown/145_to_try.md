In order to say that the speaker will try doing something as a new habit a pattern `verb + ようにする` is used. So this pattern can only be applied in situations where the speaker must change something about the lifestyle and he or she will try hard (頑張る) to follow the new lifestyle. A similar grammatical structure is `verb + ようにしています` which means that the speaker is always trying hard to do something.
In order to construct add *ようにする* to a verb in the casual form (either affirmative or negative).
To recap:
- `ようにする` - try hard from now on
- `ようにしている` - always try hard

|Form|Example|
|-|-|
|Affirmative|食べる**ようにする**|
|Negative|食べない**ようにする**|

>できるだけタバコを吸わなくて、お酒を飲まない**ようにする**。I will try not to smoke and not to drink alcohol from now on.

>日本の大学のために、毎日、日本語を勉強するようにしている。For the sake of Japanese university, I'm doing my best to study Japanese.

There are also other ways how to say to try and below are explanations of differences:
- [てみる](120) - to try something for the first time or despite the fact that it is difficult
- [ようとする](-1)) - to try something and not achieve the expected result (usually used in the past tense)
