When the speaker wants to confirm his or her actions (e.g. when following an instruction or doing some steps with a mentor) phrases `んですね` and `んですか` are used (please see [this article](34) for how to create the *んです* form). They differ in the degree of how the speaker is certain about the action. This degree is shown in the table below.

||Certainty level|
|-|-|
|んですね|90～95%|
|んですか|80%|

So the level of certainty is pretty high in both cases, therefore, do not use either `んですか` or `んですね` when you are not sure about your actions. Instead use a standard question without *んです*.

>パスポートを見せる**んですね**。So I need to show my passport?
>はい、見せてください。Yes, show it please.
