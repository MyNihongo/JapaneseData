#### And
The `と` particle is used to connect nouns with a word *"and"*, e.g. 東京と大阪 (Tokyo and Osaka). On the contrary to the [や particle](180) *と* implies that there are no items except the ones mentioned.

>日本**と**イギリスが好きです。I like Japan and the UK. (i.e. nothing more).

#### With
The `と` particle is used to indicate a person with who something is done, e.g. 友達と (with a friend).

>昨日、友達**と**東京に行きました。Yesterday I went to Tokyo with a friend.

We could develop the example above by adding more persons with who I went to Tokyo. Since these will the the only persons again `と` will be used. In the following example the first two *と* particles mean *"and"* and the last *と* particle means *"with"*.

>昨日、友達**と**父**と**母**と**東京に行きました。Yesterday I went to Tokyo with a friend, dad and mom.
