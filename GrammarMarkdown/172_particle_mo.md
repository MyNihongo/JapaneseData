#### Too, as well
The `も` particle indicates similarity to something previously mentioned.
Just like the `は` particle `も` can be used along with other particles (second example).

>ペンがあります。帽子**も**あります。I have a pen. I have a hat, too.
>大阪に行きます。東京**にも**行きます。I will go to Osaka. I will go to Tokyo, too.

The `も` particle can connect multiple nouns in the *"as well as"* clause. See the example below.

>父**も**、母**も**、弟**も**元気です。My dad, mom and younger brother, everyone is all right.

#### As many as
When the `も` particle is used along with [counters](159) it indicates a surprise of the speaker 
that there are so many items.

>猫が10匹**も**います。There are as many as 10 cats.
