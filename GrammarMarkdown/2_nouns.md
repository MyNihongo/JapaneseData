If a noun is a final object of a sentence `です` (in the formal context) and `だ` (casual context) indicate that something is. Actually the usage of *です* is much more ample, but for the time being it is more than enough. The form conjugates based on the tense (present or past) or form (affirmative or negative).

Present affirmative form:
>伊吹**です**。My name is Ibuki. (lit. I am Ibuki)
>これはペン**だ**。This is a pen.

Present negative form:
>日本人**じゃないです**。I am not Japanese. (Formal speaking)
>日本人**じゃない**。I am not Japanese. (Casual)
>日本人**ではない**。I am not Japanese. (Casual)
>日本人**ではありません**。I am not Japanese. (Formal writing)

Past affirmative form:
>自転車**でした**。It was a bicycle. (Formal)
>自転車**だった**。It was a bicycle. (Casual)

Past negative form:
>僕の所為**じゃなかったです**。It wasn't my fault. (Formal speaking)
>僕の所為**じゃなかった**。It wasn't my fault. (Casual)
>僕の所為**ではなかった**。It wasn't my fault. (Casual)
>僕の所為**ではありませんでした**。It wasn't my fault. (Formal writing)

It may be noted that in the previous sentences a subject of the sentence is omitted (e.g. `伊吹です` instead of `僕は伊吹です`). In a natural Japanese sentence a subject of the sentence is always omitted whenever it is unambiguously clear what or who the subject is. It is important to note and get used to from the very beginning, so the sentence `僕は伊吹です` is grammatically correct, but does not sound natural at all.
