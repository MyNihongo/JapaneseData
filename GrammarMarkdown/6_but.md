### でも
In order to contrast two sentences a word `でも` is used at the start of the second sentence. English equivalent of the word could be *but* or *however*.
*Note*: *でも* is used in the semi-formal (for instance with a senpai or neighbours where *です* forms are used) or casual context. In the formal context (with a boss, customers, business partners) *でも* should be avoided.
>昨日仕事があった。それ**でも**元気だ。I worked yesterday. However, I am cheerful.
>日本が好き。**でも**日本に行った事がない。I like Japan. But I have never been there.

When *でも* is used after a noun its meaning changes to "or something like this" or "even" depending on the context of a sentence, but this grammar is related to the [ても-form](127). *でも* is used in such any-words as:
- *なんでも* (anything)
- *どこでも* (anywhere)
- *いつかでも* (anytime)
- *いくらでも* (any amount, as much as you want)
- *誰でも* (anyone).
>お茶**でも**しましょう。Let's go drink tea or something.
>この漢字は日本人**でも**覚えない。Even Japanese people cannot memorise this kanji.
###　しかし
The word *しかし* has the same usage as *でも*, but *しかし* is meant for formal speech or writing.
>日本が好きです。**しかし**日本に行った事がありません。I like Japan. But I have never been there.
